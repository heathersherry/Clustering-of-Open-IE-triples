Both his parents were artists who had met at art school in Paris. Merton first went to study at Cambridge, but left after only one year, and moved to the US, to study at Columbia University, where he converted to Roman Catholicism. In 1941 he entered the Abbey of Gethsemani, Kentucky, a community of Trappists monks, and stayed a part of the community for the rest of his life. He was a prolific writer, but it is his autobiography, &apos;The Seven Storey Mountain&apos;, which is most celebrated. In the 1960s, he became increasingly political and a strong supporter of the civil rights movement. His writings on the subject led to frequent criticism, especially from other Catholics. He also became very interested in Zen Buddhism, and in promoting East-West dialogue, and this led to him being praised by the Dali Lama. He died as a result of an accidental electrocution. Merton was a keen diarist, but prohibited the publishing of much of his writing until 25 years after his death. There are now many volumes of his published diaries.

After work I head downtown to the Baton Rouge shelter which is housed in the convention center. Baton Rouge is different than Kelly. In thinking back I think the way it seemed then was that Baton Rouge was a place to escape to and San Antonio was a place to start over from. There was much less hope in this place and more a sense of futility with the system, the rules and the attitudes that governed these displaced people. FEMA and the Red Cross disappeared at 5:00 and left 4,000 evacuees in the hands of volunteers and the National Guard - not the Louisiana Guard because they were in Iraq. We did the best we could for people who stayed in their homes hoping the flood waters would recede; or for those who ran out of cash and had to move out of hotels in Houston and Shreveport; and those who had been living in their cars. The line of people checking in was endless. One young couple had been living in their car and had returned to Baton Rouge to try to pick up paychecks. It&apos;s amazing what happens when there are no phones, you have no home and you are out of money. As I checked them in the woman asked if there was a chance we could find a stroller since she had been carrying her child everywhere for a week. I went to the supply area and found one. And, I found a teddy bear too. When I returned with the blankets, cots, stroller, teddy bear and MREs the woman cried in gratitude or relief. I found them a quiet corner to set up their temporary home. These are the points of light I remember, when my small actions were received with gratitude and I felt like I was really doing some good. I was surprised at the ungraciousness of the people of Baton Rouge toward their own State&apos;s displaced people. I guess I might feel different if my Ohio city doubled in size overnight and every person was unemployed and looking for a rest room. After I left the shelter for the night, I went to five ATMs before I found one with money and to three or four stores before I found one with linens and pillows. No grocery store had ice or bottled water. Baton Rouge was under siege mentality and the people acted like it!"], "triple": ["Baton Rouge", "is different than", "Kelly"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": null, "subject": "Baton_Rouge,_Louisiana"}, "_id": 9886, "nouns": [["PERSON", "Baton"], ["ORGANIZATION", "Rouge"]]}

In June 1941 Vacuum Oil and Royal Dutch Shell Oil entered into a deal with the Soviets wherein they would purchase oil from the Soviet Union. This infuriated the Standard Oil Companies of New Jersey, which was controlled by the Rockefeller family. The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey announced its refusal to buy oil from Soviet Russia until it recognizes private property rights. The New York Times reported: &quot;The Standard of New Jersey owns a 51% interest in the Nobel Company, a Russian oil unit that was nationalized along with the rest of the Russian petroleum interests after the Soviets took charge of the Government. The Standard of New Jersey had no substantial interests in Russia prior to the nationalization of the industry. The Standard of New Jersey, through its ownership of control of the Nobel Company has a claim against the Soviet Government.&quot; [NYT 1.16.28] The New York Times reported: &quot;The Rockefellers, who are largely interested in the Standard of New Jersey and the Vacuum Oil Company, are expected to use their influence to prevent any widening of the breach between the three companies.&quot; [NYT 7.26.27] In the 1930&apos;s, John J. McCloy became a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. During World War II, John J. McCloy was an Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, and supervised the Strategic Services Unit of the War Department in 1944. In 1945 he was appointed High Commissioner to Germany, the top-ranking United States official there. By 1947 John J. McCloy was an official in the Office of Policy Coordination. He worked closely with Frank Wisner on numerous CIA operations in post-war Europe. In the early 1950&apos;s John J. McCloy pardoned Nazi war criminals, despite protests from divergent quarters. When he returned to the United States, John J. McCloy resumed his role as the Attorney for the Rockefellers, and engineered the merger of the Chase and Manhattan Banks. The Chase Manhattan Bank was employed to launder CIA funds. John J. McCloy was installed as a Director of the Chase Manhattan Bank and a Director of the Rockefeller Foundation. John J. McCloy was a Director of United Fruit. In 1959 he worked with the CIA in funding anti-Communist activities at the Vienna World Youth Festival. He was a close friend of the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, John McCone. After the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, John J. McCloy negotiated with the Russians. In 1964 John J. McCloy thought it was imperative to &quot;show the world that America is not a banana republic, where a government can be changed by a conspiracy.&quot; John J.

He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1923. This guide represents a work-in-progress. The original draft was completed by Project Archivist Peggy L. McMullen in September, 1988, finishing a complex, challenging, and difficult project begun by Arthur F. Sniffin in the fall of 1985. Throughout this period of arranging and describing elusive and sometimes indecipherable documents, we were able to draw on the expertise of Dr. Narayan Hegde. First as a graduate student, and subsequently as a consulting scholar, he had worked intermittently with the collection from its arrival at Stony Brook&apos;s Center for Contemporary Arts and Letters in 1975. Other graduate students who worked on the initial indexing of the collection in the mid-1970s were Linda Bauer, Terry Lichtenstein, and Jerry Schecter. Special Collections Department staff started planning for the housing and processing of the Yeats Collection in 1983. I am indebted to Rose C. Brown and Susan C. Rose for their continuing contributions to the overall planning, organizing, and housing of the collection, and for providing various kinds of support during the project. Timothy D. Cary and Lee R. Hiltzik also worked on many aspects of planning and implementing the project. Subsequently, Diane E. Englot has helped in revising and editing the collection.", "48.

He did some of his greatest work after he was 50 years old. Yeats was born in Dublin, Ireland, on June 13, 1865, the eldest son of an artist. Although the family soon moved to London, the children spent much time with their grandparents in County Sligo in northwestern Ireland. The scenery and folklore of this region greatly influenced Yeats&apos;s work. For a while he studied art, but during the 1890s he became active in London&apos;s literary life and helped found the Rhymers&apos; Club. Yeats&apos;s early work was not especially Irish. Soon, however, he began to look to the ancient rituals and pagan beliefs of the land for his artistic inspiration. He tried to merge this interest with his aristocratic tastes to create an original Irish poetry and to establish his own identity. In 1896 Yeats met Lady Gregory, an aristocrat and playwright who shared his interest in Ireland&apos;s past, especially in its folklore. In 1899 they formed a literary society that was the predecessor of the Abbey Theatre. Among his plays were &apos;The Countess Cathleen&apos; (1892) and &apos;Cathleen ni Houlihan&apos; (1902), with Maud Gonne originating the title role. In 1899 he had proposed to her, but she refused to marry him. He later proposed to her daughter, who also refused. A free Ireland was the object of the actress&apos; passion, and Yeats&apos;s love for her kindled his interest in the country&apos;s political struggles. From 1922 until 1928 he was a senator in the Dail Eireann, or Irish parliament."], "triple": ["Yeats", "was born in", "Dublin"], "kbp_info": [["PERSON", "per:city_of_birth", "LOCATION"]], "entity_linking": {"object": "Dublin", "subject": "William_Butler_Yeats"}, "_id": 116415, "nouns": [["GPE", "Dublin"]]}

It had been seared on a tiny hibachi grill until the proteins were just set and was, quite simply, the sweetest, most intense crab meat I had ever eaten. I was in no doubt. Tokyo was obviously the greatest food city in the world. I had been in town for three hours.This week, after a slightly more rigorous appraisal of the city&apos;s restaurants involving a year and a half&apos;s work and five full-time inspectors, the Michelin Guide confirmed what it had taken me half a dinner time to conclude. London&apos;s restaurants have 50 Michelin stars between them. Paris, birthplace of the grand restaurant, has 98. In its first ever guide to Tokyo, the Japanese capital has been awarded 191, spread across eight three-stars, 25 two-stars and a whopping 117 one-stars. It&apos;s official. Tokyo is belly heaven. Having spent a week eating around Tokyo earlier this year - lunch, dinner, lunch, dinner, lunch, lunch, dinner, dinner; I am nothing if not committed - I have only one doubt over this galaxy of Michelin stars: they really haven&apos;t awarded anywhere near enough of them. I went to Tokyo in search of the perfect meal for my new book, The Man Who Ate The World, about the globalisation of high-end restaurants. I had already played poker to win the price of a glass of Ch\u00e2teau d&apos;Yquem at Nobu in Las Vegas. I had cruised the mafia bling of Moscow and been fed Escoffier classics amid the ludicrous desert fantasies of Dubai. And in all of these cities identifying the high-end restaurants to visit had been easy. The list was always relatively short, relatively uncontroversial and generally included the words Gordon and Ramsay. Tokyo was entirely different. There are, according to whom you talk to, either 60,000, 160,00 or 300,000 restaurants there. All we can know for sure is that there are an Awful Lot Of Them. I asked a dozen knowledgeable people for a list of must-do restaurants. I got back a dozen different lists. (None of them included the words Gordon or Ramsay.) But each time I was also given a warning. They could tell me where it would be great to eat, but getting to do so was a different matter entirely. In the west, restaurants are relatively democratic affairs. If you can scrape together the cash, and book far enough in advance, you can go. Japanese high-end restaurants are not like that at all. For a start, many are tiny, seating fewer than a dozen people and sometimes just four or six. Second, they are seriously bloody choosy about who they feed. I approached a foodie friend, a San Francisco-based Thai food-blogger called Pim Techamuanvivit, whose blog, Chez Pim, has become a cult. She is seriously connected. She has eaten her way around Tokyo. How could I go about securing reservations, I asked. She laughed, and not in a good way. &quot;They won&apos;t let you in,&quot; she said. &quot;You&apos;re a round eye.&quot; In short, gaijin are not welcome. Hell, even being Japanese won&apos;t necessarily do it. Many places regard the right to be a customer as a privilege to be bestowed rather than bought for the cost of dinner. The very least you need is a personal introduction by an existing customer, and ideally a blood relationship, a certificate bearing the thumb prints of three European popes, and a winning smile. Oh, and shed loads of cash: \u00a3500 a head for dinner in one of these places is really not extraordinary. For all these reasons I had serious doubts when I heard that Michelin was scouring Tokyo for worthy recipients of its stars. The three French inspectors wouldn&apos;t have a hope in hell of making it inside the serious Japanese places, and the two local inspectors might not fare much better either. Eventually, to secure my bookings, I had to fall on the mercy of the executive chef at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, where I was staying; thank you, Mr Yamamoto. I couldn&apos;t have done it without you. Who was going to make all the introductions for the Michelin crew, who needed to visit anonymously? The results published this week appear to have borne out my concerns. The place where I ate that fabulous crab, Yukimura, a simple unprepossessing dining room on the third floor of a residential apartment block that could seat just nine, has made it into the guide. It has earned a single star for its extraordinary, multi-course set tasting menu of raw scallop with shaved, dried sea cucumber, raw venison the colour of a fresh haemorrhage, tiny white vinegared fish, crab legs and brown meat and a whole bunch of other things besides. The two other high-end Japanese restaurants I visited, which were of an equal quality, are nowhere to be seen. Michelin simply appears not to have found them. And no wonder. The sushi place where I ate, Okei, was the smallest high-end restaurant I visited in the course of researching my book. It served just one person that night (although it can seat six). That person was me. Oh, and the sushi was very, very good indeed. My 32 courses - seared belly tuna, grilled marinated clam, nigiri of sea bream and salmon and sea urchin - cost me \u00a3250. It felt like a bargain. Unsurprisingly, where Tokyo-based western restaurants are concerned, the professional eaters of Michelin appear to be on much more solid ground. One of the things that defines the city is its openness to other culinary traditions. Today, every big-name chef is setting up outposts in any global city with a smattering of spare cash. Tokyo has been at this game for decades, ever since the French uber-chef Paul Bocuse first toured the country in the late 1960s. As far back as the early 1970s, Maxim&apos;s of Paris, one of the first restaurants in the world to win three Michelin stars back in the 1930s, had an outpost on the ground floor of the Sony building in downtown Tokyo. Today, everybody from Alain Ducasse to Wolfgang Puck, Michel Troisgros to Pierre Gagnaire has successful restaurants in Tokyo and all have a few more stars this week than they had last. There is one exception to this list. Gordon Ramsay has a restaurant in Tokyo, at the Conrad Hotel. For the first time since he won his first stars at Aubergine in the mid-90s, Michelin has decided a Ramsay business is worth not even a single star. It is a major slap around the chops for the boy from Glasgow Rangers. The real winner is the Frenchman Joel Robuchon, who suddenly finds himself the proud owner of six more Michelin stars, spread across a three-star, a two-star and a one-star restaurant in Tokyo. It brings his global haul to 17. (Ducasse is just behind with 15.) It would be easy to dismiss this as the impeccably French tyre company looking after its own. Irritatingly, they have probably called it right, not least because Robuchon, once named chef of the century, understands the Japanese aesthetic better than almost any other western chef. Because here is the most interesting thing about the booming, intricate obsessive restaurant scene in Tokyo: it is now having a major impact on high-end gastronomy in the west. Today, any big-name chef worth their Maldon sea salt wouldn&apos;t be seen dead serving a mere starter-main-dessert three-course meal. Instead, it&apos;s about tasting menus of 12 or 20 or even 30 tiny courses. That is a direct lift from the Japanese tradition of multi-course menus. Likewise, the introduction of smaller courses draws chefs back to less intricate plates, pointing up single ingredients, very much a part of the Japanese aesthetic. And the fashion for hot jellies and foams, made popular by the likes of Heston Blumenthal of the Fat Duck in Bray and Ferran Adri\u00e0 of El Bulli in Spain, draws on seaweed extracts which have been known to Japanese chefs for decades. Not that the eaters of Tokyo will give a damn about any of this. Nor, indeed, are they likely to care much what Michelin thinks of their city&apos;s restaurants. They didn&apos;t need the French to come and tell them just how good the eating opportunities are in their town. They&apos;ve always known. This Michelin Guide is for the rest of us, or at least those of us who care just a little too much about our dinner. We can only flick through its pages, read the descriptions of food we are never likely to be able to eat, and dream. Where to eat, what to eat ... and why the food&apos;s so good Japanese food experts give the lowdown on dining out in Tokyo Kanehiro Takase Head chef at Matsuri St James&apos;s, London &quot;There are three issues at heart here. The most important thing is the very good quality of the ingredients that you can get hold of in Tokyo if you are prepared to pay the prices. This applies to fish, meat, vegetables and fruit. In addition to this there is an innate awareness of Japanese people with regard to the safe preparation of the ingredients. Finally, the Japanese have a very strong passion for food and do not mind paying high prices to eat it if it&apos;s delicious. &quot;If visitors are looking for something tasty but which is good value for money, they should eat around the famous Tsukiji market. I recommend eating sushi in one of the restaurants there or donburi [rice with a topping such as meat or eel]. If they are happy to pay a lot of money to dine well, then there are lots of very good restaurants in Ginza. I recommend eating tempura at a specialist tempura restaurant, such as Ten-ichi or Tenkuni.&quot; Ichiro Kubota Head chef at Uma, London &quot;Michelin is French and can easily assess French restaurants, but I think their guides to other places in the world are more commercial than authentic. I know two of their judges were Japanese, but even so ... In Japan there is so much diverstity. There are sushi restaurants, tempura restaurants and kaiseki restaurants which, like French restaurants, are based on tasting menus comprised of seven to 10 dishes. Kaiseki is a completely different world from sushi. However, Michelin generalised all the cuisine as &apos;Japanese&apos;. &quot;Japanese cuisine is much more profound than everyone thinks. French food is renowned all over the world and translates very well, whereas kaiseki comes from the beginnings of Japanese culture. You have to understand the philosophies of ancient tea ceremonies to appreciate the service, host, dish and chef. And you have to know about the ingredients. For example, each colour means something: carrot and raddish mean &apos;celebration&apos;, yellow kombu [seaweed] is for new year&apos;s eve because it means &apos;happy&apos;, or &apos;to laugh&apos;. &quot;The best foods to try in Kyoto are simple edo mai-sushi, which is hand-pressed nigiri made with rice and raw fish. Edo mai means &apos;in front of Tokyo Bay&apos; - they use fish freshly caught from the bay. And Kamoseiro is soba noodles made from buckwheat, mixed with soup stock and duck fat - giving it a rich taste - and served warm with duck.&quot; Janina Wolkow Owner of Sumosan restaurant, London &quot;I wish Michelin had written this guide sooner, as it would have helped on my Tokyo trips. The last time I went with my head chef we literally did dinner twice each evening because there were so many places we wanted to try. Be warned, though: if you go to restaurants that aren&apos;t designed for foreigners, no one will speak English, so all you can do is point to things on the menu and hope for the best. &quot;The raw materials in Tokyo are amazing. Even the beef section in a supermarket can be breathtaking and would turn a non-vegetarian into a meat eater. The best things I ate in Tokyo were seafood kimchi (actually a Korean dish made with spicy, fermented cabbage) that was served on a hollowed grapefruit. Through the flavoursome marinade, you could still taste the freshness of the fish. There was a knife stuck through the grapefruit, which they pulled out as they served it, to release dry ice. And the clams on the sushi they serve are still alive. We just don&apos;t get that over here.&quot; Malcolm Simpson General manager of Bincho Yakitori in London&apos;s Oxo Tower &quot;Unlike here, you won&apos;t find different kinds of Japanese food in one restaurant. There, one will serve, for example, yakitori - chicken skewers - and another will do only sushi. There are 80,000 bars and restaurants there and they&apos;re often piled eight stories high on top of each other. You have to look up to find them. &quot;There are two kinds of fine dining there: restaurants for the rich expat market and then the true fine dining aimed at anyone who has money. The Japanese are very much into trying things new and western and they demand everything to be authentic. So Joel Robuchon, who won three stars for his French restaurant there, imports everything. The clientele demands that and don&apos;t mind paying for it. My best Tokyo food experience was at Tsukiji fish market near Tokyo Bay. Some Japanese friends and I paid \u00a350 for two big bricks of tuna, which we chopped up and ate on the spot with some wasabi and soy sauce.&quot; Hiroyuki Saotome Executive chef of Saki, London &quot;The [Michelin] selection is skewed toward more contemporary and creative Japanese restaurants [more appealing to non-Japanese customers] with a wide selection of wine. This is why the list looks kind of surprising for those who are used to appreciating the authentic Japanese eateries. &quot;What makes Tokyo stand out is the ingredients. Restaurateurs and shops only accept the freshest quality and don&apos;t hesitate to return whatever whenever the quality doesn&apos;t satisfy them. &quot;In London, it is a continuous struggle and you have to keep telling your suppliers what our quality standards are. In Japan, it is a completely different game altogether. The particular difference is the fish. For vegetables, I can find great quality [here in Britain], even better than those I find in Japan. However, when it comes to fish, the difference is like heaven and hell. &quot;[As for] one dish to eat in Tokyo, this is a very difficult question. In Tokyo, if you plan to dine in a very good Japanese restaurant, you don&apos;t come to eat a &apos;dish&apos; but the &apos;season&apos;. &quot;But if I had to suggest just one dish to take away from your whole Tokyo experience, there are so many good things to try, but just for the reason that it is is only available in Japan, I would pick fugu [the potentially deadly blowfish].&quot; \u00b7 Interviews by Amy Fleming and Homa Khaleeli \u00b7 Jay Rayner is the Observer&apos;s restaurant critic.

Biography Maurice Maeterlinck was born in Ghent, Belgium, in a wealthy, French-speaking family. He wrote poems and short novels during his studies, which he destroyed later; only fragments are left. After finishing his law studies, he spent a few months in Paris, France. He met there some members of the then new Symbolism movement, Villiers de l&apos;Isle Adam in particular. The latter would have a big influence on the work of Maeterlinck. He became famous with his play La princesse Maleine in 1890, and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1911. Main themes in his work are death and the meaning of life. He had a relationship with the singer Georgette Leblanc from 1895 till 1918. In 1919 he married Ren\u00c3\u00a9e Dahon; together they went to the United States. In 1930 he bought a ch\u00c3\u00a2teau in Nice, France, and named it Orlamonde, a name occurring in his work Quinze Chansons. He was made a count by King Albert I of Belgium in 1932.

Tentatively titled The Search for the Next American Band, the show will have the same format as Idol, taking bands of all ages, genres, and styles through an audition phase, a secondary phase in which judges narrow the field to 10, followed by a finalist phase voted on by viewers. Three bands will compete in the show&apos;s finale. The show will also dig into the bands&apos; personal stories and focus on their interpersonal relationships and conflicts. Idol creator Simon Fuller created the new show and will executive produce with Idol producers Nigel Lythgoe, Ken Warwick, and Cecile Frot-Coutaz. Lythgoe and Warwick recently announced that they were stepping down as producers of the Emmys broadcast to focus on other projects. FremantleMedia North America and 19 Entertainment will also produce. The show was announced on Wednesday&apos;s (May 9) results episode of American Idol. There is no airdate set, but the producers are trying to ready the new show for a once-a-week airing starting this fall. The Halcyon Co., Derek Anderson and Victor Kubicek&apos;s new privately-financed production company, has acquired all rights to the Terminator franchise and plans to make a new trilogy. Terminator 4, which will be based on a script by T3 writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris, picks up with John Connor in his 30s leading what&apos;s left of the human race against the machines. The producers plan to start preproduction immediately for a planned first-half 2009 release. No director or cast has been selected yet, but it is expected that the new trilogy will reinvent the franchise with new actors and plotlines. ( ) Eddie Murphy will star in multiple roles in a film adaptation of Fantasy Island for Columbia Pictures. The project will turn the popular TV series, which ran from 1978-84 and starred Ricardo Montalban, into a family comedy. Jay Scherick and David Ronn are writing. They most recently teamed with Murphy on Norbit. Murphy is currently featured repsiring his role as the voice of Donkey in the third installment of Shrek, and he will next be seen in 20th Century Fox&apos;s comedy Starship Dave. ( ) Luke Wilson will star in the dramedy Henry Poole Is Here for Lakeshore Entertainment and director Mark Pellington (The Mothman Prophecies). Wilson will play a man who discovers he has only six weeks to live and decides he wants to just disappear into suburbia and live on a diet of pizza, Twinkies, and vodka. The project will be shopped at this year&apos;s Cannes. Wilson will next be seen in The Wendell Baker Story, which he wrote and co-directed, and You Kill Me, alongside Ben Kingsley and Tea Leoni. ( ) The U. S. Treasury Department is investigating filmmaker Michael Moore for taking Sept. 11 rescue workers to Cuba in his upcoming health-care documentary Sicko. The Treasury Department&apos;s Office of Foreign Assets Control notified Moore in a letter dated May 2 that it was conducting a civil investigation for possible violations of the U.S. trade embargo restricting travel to Cuba, according to the Associated Press. In February, Moore took ailing workers from the Ground Zero rescue effort in Manhattan for treatment in Cuba, according to a person the AP says worked with the filmmaker on the release of Sicko. No potential penalties were specified, but in 2003, the New York Yankees paid the government $75,000 to settle a dispute that it conducted business in violation of the Cuba embargo. ( ) Matthew Perry, Hilary Swank tapped for indie comedy Matthew Perry and Hilary Swank have been tapped for Laws of Motion, an indie comedy from Plum Pictures, Ideal Partners Film Fund, and Hilary Swank Prods. Ben Foster (Six Feet Under) is also in talks to star. Perry will play a husband struggling with his career and his free-spirited brother (Foster) and sister. Swank play a supporting role as the all-too-perfect neighbor of Perry&apos;s harried character. Production is scheduled to start this month. Perry&apos;s most recent movie, Numb, premiered at Tribeca this year. Swank will next be seen in Warner Bros. &apos; P.S. I Love You with Gerald Butler, and she will also produce Labyrinth for Summit Entertainment, a thriller in which she might also star. ( ) Tim Roth will play Emil Blonsky, the alter ego of Abomination, the Hulk&apos;s adversary in the upcoming movie adaptation. Blonsky is a KGB agent who deliberately exposes himself to the gamma rays that caused Bruce Banner to turn into the Hulk. Blonsky ups the dosage, making him larger and stronger than the Hulk, but he is also unable to change back to human form. He blames Banner for the problem and vows to destroy the Hulk. Roth joins Edward Norton, who plays Banner, and Liv Tyler in the Louis Leterrier-directed drama, which is due June 13, 2008.

Richard Clarke&apos;s account in his book, &quot;Against All Enemies,&quot; corroborates Mineta&apos;s timeline, which was evidently so threatening to the official story that Mineta&apos;s testimony was deleted from the 9/11 Commission video archives. General Richard Myers contradicted his own story in several incarnations of his alibi as did Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, both of whom claimed to be unaware of unfolding events when, according to Richard Clarke, they were both participating in a live video teleconference initiated by Clarke at about 9:10. Griffin skillfully analyzes these contradictory versions of events. The Commission&apos;s claim that the FAA did not notify the military early enough to scramble jets was contradicted by the FAA&apos;s assertion that not only was a military liaison present throughout its nationwide alert but &quot;within minutes after the first aircraft hit the World Trade Center it immediately established several phone bridges that included.DOD, the Secret Service, and other government agencies.&quot; NORAD&apos;s original (September 18, 2001) timeline corroborated FAA statements as did military officers, such as the National Military Command Center&apos;s Brigadier General Montague Winfield and NORAD&apos;s Captain Michael Jellinek. One also learns from Richard Clarke that the &quot;Secret Service had a system that allowed them to see what FAA&apos;s radar was seeing.&quot; The 9/11 Commission&apos;s claim, therefore, would be laughable had the consequences of this lie not been so tragic. Griffin presents extensive eye-witness accounts by firefighters, police officers, journalists and building workers who gave vivid reports of hearing and seeing powerful sequential explosions within all three of the World Trade Center skyscrapers prior to their collapse. Building 7, which was not hit by a plane, also collapsed symmetrically into its own footprint around 5:20 pm - an event that was anticipated and communicated to firefighters by Mayor Giuliani&apos;s Office of Emergency Management around noon. Griffin poses the question to NIST, the agency tasked by the Commission with explaining the destruction of the Twin Towers and WTC7, how OEM could have known so many hours in advance that the building would collapse. Further evidence of controlled demolition is suggested by three professors at Worcester Polytechnic Institute who noted the peculiar characteristics of oxidation and sulfidation on salvaged WTC steel beams. NIST admitted that the temperature of the fires was insufficient (by at least 1000\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdF) to melt steel. However, if thermate cutter charges (thermite plus sulfur) were used to slice the steel framework, that would explain the molten steel. How did NIST and the 9/11 Commission explain the eyewitness testimony that steel had melted? By not mentioning it. Several chapters are devoted to exposing contradictions concerning the alleged hijackers. The assertion that Hani Hanjour could have flown American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon after making a spectacular 330\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd turn over prohibited airspace is demonstrably preposterous given his record of total incompetence as a pilot. The profile of Mohamed Atta as a devout Muslim on a sacred suicide mission is contradicted by numerous eye-witnesses who described his unholy lifestyle in vivid detail. The FBI&apos;s assertion that Atta&apos;s personal belongings provided a treasure trove of incriminating evidence (a Koran, his Will and a list of the 19 hijackers) is dubious, given the FBI&apos;s inconsistent versions of where this miraculous proof was found. It was first reportedly found in a white Mitsubishi at Logan airport in Boston. That story was changed when a subsequent tale proved to be false. After the FBI claimed that two hijackers named Bukhari had driven a blue Nissan to Portland, Maine, and then taken a commuter flight back to Boston on the morning of 9/11, it was discovered that one Bukhari had died the previous year and the other was still alive. The FBI clumsily merged these stories by claiming that Atta drove the blue Nissan to Portland and then took the commuter flight back. In this new story, the incriminating evidence was &quot;found&quot; in his luggage, which failed to get transferred to Flight 11. The public belief that Middle Eastern men hijacked the planes was based heavily on media reports of over 15 cell phone calls from passengers to relatives, although high-altitude cell phone calls were not possible in 2001. One source of the hijacker tale came from the Justice Department&apos;s Solicitor General, Ted Olson, who told CNN that his wife (Barbara) had called him twice from American Flight 77. That claim was contradicted at the Zacarias Moussaoui trial in 2006 when the FBI reported that only two cell phone calls were made from all four planes, and that both calls originated from United Flight 93 (after it had descended to 5,000 feet). How did the Commission reconcile FBI records with reports from family members who recognized Caller IDs made from cell phones? It omitted the FBI records. Why do these contradictions matter? The story of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and nineteen Muslim hijackers is based entirely on unverified claims. Despite promises of forthcoming evidence, the US government has yet to deliver any hard evidence. To this day, the FBI&apos;s web page concerning Osama bin Laden does not accuse him of involvement with the 9/11 attacks. Why not? An FBI official has admitted, &quot;The FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11.&quot; What, then, is the justification for attacking two sovereign nations and killing over one million civilians? Although Griffin refrains from making direct accusations, he methodically presents objective evidence that leads the reader to an inevitable conclusion ~ that the purpose of the 9/11 Commission was to assign guilt where it did not exist and to cover up guilt where it did, thereby obstructing criminal indictments for treason, mass murder, war crimes, crimes against humanity and crimes against the earth. Griffin&apos;s impeccable research should inspire public demand for an independent investigation of 9/11. The enormous public service Griffin has provided in preparing this meticulous archive cannot be over-stated. Any investigative journalist worthy of that title would need only to validate this archive of facts. With the precision and skill of a seasoned District Attorney, David Ray Griffin presents a case that is so well organized it could be used intact by any prosecutor devoted to uncovering the truth.

The John Mark in Acts (xii, 12, 25; xv, 37) mentioned as John (xiii, 5, 13) and as Mark (xv, 39) is surely the Mark mentioned by Paul (Colossians., iv, 10; II Tim., iv, 11; Philem., 24) and by Peter in I Peter, v, 13. Mark of the Pauline Epistles was the cousin (anepsios) of Barnabas (Colossians., iv, 10), to whom Mark of Acts seems to have been bound by some special tie (Acts, xv, 37, 39). Mark&apos;s mother was a prominent member of the earliest group of Christians in Jerusalem; it was to her house that Peter turned on his release from prison; the house was approached by a porch (pulon), there was a slave girl (paidiske) to open the door, and the house was a meeting-place for the brethren, &quot;many&quot; of whom were praying there the night St. Peter arrived from prison (Acts, xii, 12-13). (text based on N.T. sources) A further report of Mark as the amanuensis of Peter and the Secret Gospel of Mark is given in a letter of Clement of Alexandria (died ca 211 - 216), transcribed into a printed book in the monastery of Mar Saba, south of Jerusalem. In it Clement states\\ :&quot;&quot;As for Mark, then, during Peter&apos;s stay in Rome he wrote an account of the Lord&apos;s doings, not, however, declaring all of them, nor yet hinting at the secret ones, but selecting what he thought most useful for increasing the faith of those who were being instructed. But when Peter died a martyr, Mark came over to Alexandria, bringing both his own notes and those of Peter, from which he transferred to his former book the things suitable to whatever makes for progress toward knowledge. Thus he composed a more spiritual Gospel for the use of those who were being perfected. Nevertheless, he yet did not divulge the things not to be uttered, nor did he write down the hierophantic teaching of the Lord, but to the stories already written he added yet others and, moreover, brought in certain sayings of which he knew the interpretation would, as a mystagogue, lead the hearers into the innermost sanctuary of that truth hidden by seven veils. Thus, in sum, he prepared matters, neither grudgingly nor incautiously, in my opinion, and, dying, he left his composition to the church in Alexandria, where it even yet is most carefully guarded, being read only to those who are being initiated into the great mysteries.&quot; Legendary details \\ An extensive and satisfyingly circumstantial account of Mark&apos;s life was written by Severus, Bishop of Al-Ushmunain, in the 10th century. According to this account, Mark was the nephew of Barnabas, who was cousin to Peter&apos;s wife. Mark was one of the servants at the wedding feast at Cana who poured out the water that Jesus Christ turned to wine. This is Jesus&apos; first public miracle, however it is not related in the Gospel of Mark. Mark was one of the Seventy Apostles sent out by Christ; he was the servant who carried water to the house of Simon the Cyrenian, where the Last Supper took place; and Mark was the one who hosted the disciples in his house after the death of Jesus, and into whose house the resurrected Jesus Christ came, although all the doors were shut. The following details are also based on Severus&apos; account, and need corroboration before they are accepted as more than 10th century pious legend: He eventually went to Alexandria and was the first to preach the Gospel there. He is said to have performed many miracles, and established a church there, appointing a bishop, three priests, and seven deacons. Mark is considered by this writer to have founded the School of Alexandria, a school that encouraged studies in science, philosophy, music, math and language embraced by the early Copts, who believe such disciplines are not contrary to religion, but lead believers to a true spiritual life. The pagan Library and Musaeum are ignored. When Mark returned to Alexandria, the people there are said to have resented his efforts to turn them away from the worship of their traditional Egyptian gods. In 68 A.D. they killed him, and tried to burn his body. Afterwards, the Christians in Alexandria removed his unburned body from the ashes, wrapped it and then buried it in the easterly part of the church they had built. His remains were later stolen and taken to Venice. They were not returned to Egypt until 1968. However, the first reports of his execution by burning date to the 4th century and are considered apocryphal by many church historians. It should be noted that Severus&apos; account is not entirely reconcilable with the first accounts we have of St. Mark. Papias says that he was a disciple of Peter and never knew Jesus himself. Papias says Mark wrote down the stories Peter told, but not necessarily in chronological order. It is unlikely that the early church would remember a story which made the authorship of Mark&apos;s Gospel seem less authoritative than it was. Representations in Western art \\  depicts St Mark as a lion in front of the city of Venice.]]\\ Mark is frequently depicted in Western art, especially Renaissance art. Like the other 3 evangelists, he is often shown holding a book, but his special attribute is the winged lion. As the patron saint of Venice, he was a particular favorite of Venetian artists and their patrons, and paintings of his life and miracles are a feature of some of the greatest Venetian art. His lion is ubiquitous throughout Venice.

Citrulline Malate (CM) also boosts energy levels at the cellular level, eliminates metabolic pollutants such as ammonia and lactic acid (produced from all exercise), supports immune health and as mentioned increases arginine production to fuel NO output. MRM&apos;s unique selection of Arginine Di Malate as well as Citrulline Malate was well researched. Malate supports the recycling of lactate and pyruvate and is greatly involved in the kreb&apos;s cycle. Most importantly, malate boosts and maintains our energy cycle. In addition, CM has shown to support recovery after exercise by stimulating phosphocreatine reuptake leading to faster recovery between workouts. Guanidino Propionic Acid (GPA) is a phenomenal ingredient added to Metabolic Pump. GPA has shown to mimic the action of insulin without the need for high glycemic carbohydrates. This insulin mimicking action efficiently transports nutrients throughout the body, supports glucose reuptake into the muscle and efficiently shuttles creatine into the muscle cell. With over 15 years of prominent and positive research on creatine monohydrate, MRM has chosen to stick with science and utilize the monohydrate form of creatine to support recovery and muscle growth. VasoPhenol was developed by MRM to further enhance vasodilation, vascularity and muscle pump with the clinically proven benefits of grape seed and ginkgo biloba.

His father \u2014 a man of great talent \u2014 was a lawyer, strongly imbued with French eighteenth-century ideas of religion, science, and art; his mother was the descendant of Hungarian Jews, who in the seventeenth century settled in Holland. Amongst his earliest friends and playmates were Jenny \u2014 afterwards his wife \u2014 and Edgar von Westphalen. From their father, the Baron von Westphalen \u2014 himself half a Scot \u2014 Karl Marx imbibed his first love for the \u201cRomantic\u201d School, and while his father read him Voltaire and Racine, Westphalen read him Homer and Shakespere. These always remained his favorite writers. At once much loved and feared by his school-fellows \u2014 loved because he was always in mischief, and feared because of his readiness in writing satirical verse and lampooning his enemies, Karl Marx passed through the usual school routine, and then proceeded to the Universities of Bonn and Berlin, where, to please his father, he for a time studied law, and to please himself he studied history and philosophy. In 1842 he was about to habilitate himself at Bonn as \u201cPrivat Dozent,\u201d but the political movement arisen in Germany since the death of Frederick William III. in 1840, threw him into another career. The chiefs of the Rhenish Liberals \u2014 Kamphausen and Hansemann \u2014 had founded the Rhenish Gazette at Cologne, with the co-operation of Marx, whose brilliant and bold criticism of the provincial Landtag created such a sensation, that, though only twenty-four years old, he was offered the chief editorship of the paper. He accepted it, and therewith began his long struggle with all despotisms, and with Prussian despotism in particular. Of course the paper appeared under the supervision of a censor \u2014 but the poor censor found himself powerless. The Gazette invariably published all important articles, and the censor could do nothing. Then a second, a \u201cspecial\u201d one was sent from Berlin, but even this double censorship proved of no avail, and finally in 1843 the government simply suppressed the paper altogether. In the same year, 1843, Marx had married his old friend and playfellow, to whom he had been engaged for seven years, Jenny von Westphalen, and with his young wife proceeded to Paris. Here, together with Arnold Ruge, he published the Deutsche Franzische Jahrbher, in which he began the long series of his socialist writings. His first contribution was a critique on Hegel\u2019s \u201cRechts-philosophie;\u201d the second, an essay on the \u201cJewish Question.\u201d When the Jahrbher ceased to appear, Marx contributed to the journal Votwtz, of which he is usually said to have been the editor. As a matter of fact, the editorship of this paper to which Heine, Everbeck, Engels, etc., contributed, seems to have been carried on in a somewhat erratic manner, and a really responsible editor never existed.

In reality it is very simple. Hegel says that in the theoretical analysis of anything, which for him means a study of it in its self-development and inevitable self-transformation, do not do what Carter does constantly, check off a list of items, in other words \u201cthe multiplicity and contingency of the phenomenal\u201d, the ever-changing outward historical forms. He says: seek its notion, that inner relation from which all external developments must flow until this inner contradiction is abolished. Marx reduces his analysis of capitalist production to an ever-wonderful miracle of notional simplicity, stripped of all contingency: less and less of the day\u2019s labor going to the worker, more and more going to the other moment, or active factor, the machinery. This is the mark of capitalist production and when Carter quotes Marx to show that I confuse all types of society, I realise with deep concern the gulf that separates us, not on Russia, but on historical materialism and Capital. For although debate on Russia is understandable, it is a miserable business when you have to stop to explain that this sharp relation within the working-day has nothing to do with, e.g., feudalism. That rapidly developing relation and its laws form for Marx the \u201cinner nature\u201d of capital, and the consequences were analysed by Marx with a logical direction, a mastery of his material and a vivid concreteness, equalled nowhere except in the arrogance and obtuseness with which it is ignored. The self-expanding value expands itself according to its \u201cnotion\u201d, accumulated labor devouring living labor. Marx was supremely confident that he had found here the notion of the \u201cstrict process of production\u201d, the abstract logical relation around whose development all future historical society would revolve (as it did not revolve in the past) until the abolition of the capitalist system of production. For the word abolition, aufhebung, Marx went again to Hegel, to show quite clearly what he had in mind. Aufhebung is second in Hegelian importance only to Begriff.

When they were not together they used to study the same subjects in order to communicate to each other the results of their researches. They had the highest opinion of each other and did not think so highly of criticisms from other sources. Marx was never weary of expressing astonishment at the universality of the knowledge of Engels, as well as the wonderful keenness of his mind, which enabled him to see things with lightning rapidity; and Engels was always ready to recognise the powers of Marx\u2019s analysis and synthesis. \u201cCertainly,\u201d he said to me one day, \u201cpeople had always seen that there was a great deal of importance to be attached to capitalist production, and that it was necessary to ascertain and explain the laws of its development, but this had demanded too much time and the work had only been done in parts and in fragments. Marx alone was prepared to show as a whole the effects of economic causes, to exhibit the dependence of their relations with each other, and thus, so to speak, to reconstruct the whole of the theoretic monument of economics and to show the importance of it in the evolution of society.\u201d"], "triple": ["Marx", "went to", "London"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "London", "subject": "Karl_Marx"}, "_id": 70478, "nouns": [["GPE", "Engels"], ["GPE", "London"], ["PERSON", "Park Road"], ["GPE", "Maitland Park"], ["PERSON", "Marx"]]}

The Communist League was no more. Only a small number of workers remained clustering about the Communist Workers&apos; Educational Society and eking out a precarious living as tailors and compositors. Only at the end of 1851 an opportunity to write for the New York Tribune suddenly presented itself to Marx. The New York Tribune was then one of the most influential papers. Charles Dana, one of the editors of the Tribune, who had been in Germany and who had met Marx during the Revolution of 1848, invited Marx to write a series of articles on Germany for the paper. Dana had been in Cologne and he knew the important position Marx occupied among the German journalists. Having taken to heart the interests of his German readers (German immigration into the United States during the Revolution had greatly increased), Dana decided for their benefit to enlarge the section of the Tribune dealing with Western Europe. This unforeseen invitation brought in its train some embarrassments, for at that time Marx was not yet able to write English. He turned to Engels for help, and a very curious form of collaboration was established. We have already seen that the Communist Manifesto, though it appeared under the joint names of Marx and Engels, was overwhelmingly the work of Marx. Engels&apos; contribution to it was almost as little as had been his contribution to their common work, The Holy Family. Now it was Engels who performed the major task. His articles were later collected into a separate volume called Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Germany. Marx was credited with this book, but from their correspondence we now know that Engels was the author. However, ideologically it was the common work of Marx and Engels. The latter wrote it on the basis of ideas and facts that were supplied by Marx, and chiefly on the basis of the articles which they had both been writing for the Neue Rheinische Zeitung. Thus began Marx&apos;s relations with the New York Tribune.

Despite their criticism of Hegel&apos;s metaphysical assumptions, they made use of Hegel&apos;s dialectical method, separated from its theological content, as a powerful weapon for the critique of established religion and politics. Some members of this circle drew an analogy between post-Aristotelian philosophy and post-Hegelian philosophy. One of them, Max Stirner, turned critically against both Feuerbach and Bauer in his book &quot;Der Einzige und sein Eigenthum&quot; (1845, The Ego and Its Own), calling these atheists &quot;pious people&quot; for their reification of abstract concepts. Marx, at that time a follower of Feuerbach, was deeply impressed by the work and abandoned Feuerbachian materialism and accomplished what recent authors have denoted as an &quot;epistemological break.&quot; He developed the basic concept of historical materialism against Stirner in his book &quot;Die Deutsche Ideologie&quot; (1846, The German Ideology), which he did not publish. Another link to the Young Hegelians was Moses Hess, with whom Marx eventually disagreed, yet to whom he owed many of his insights into the relationship between state, society and religion.

Marx, Karl, was born on May 5, 1818 (New Style), in the city of Trier (Rhenish Prussia). His father was a lawyer, a Jew, who in 1824 adopted Protestantism. The family was well-to-do, cultured, but not revolutionary. After graduating from a Gymnasium in Trier, Marx entered the university, first at Bonn and later in Berlin, where he read law, majoring in history and philosophy. He concluded his university course in 1841, submitting a doctoral thesis on the philosophy of Epicurus. At the time Marx was a Hegelian idealist in his views. In Berlin, he belonged to the circle of &quot;Left Hegelians&quot; (Bruno Bauer and others) who sought to draw atheistic and revolutionary conclusion from Hegel&apos;s philosophy. After graduating, Marx moved to Bonn, hoping to become a professor. However, the reactionary policy of the government, which deprived Ludwig Feuerbach of his chair in 1832, refused to allow him to return to the university in 1836, and in 1841 forbade young Professor Bruno Bauer to lecture at Bonn, made Marx abandon the idea of an academic career. Left Hegelian views were making rapid headway in Germany at the time. Feuerbach began to criticize theology, particularly after 1836, and turn to materialism, which in 1841 gained ascendancy in his philosophy (The Essence of Christianity). The year 1843 saw the appearance of his Principles of the Philosophy of the Future. &quot;One must oneself have experienced the liberating effect&quot; of these books, Engels subsequently wrote of these works of Feuerbach. &quot;We [i.e., the Left Hegelians, including Marx] all became at once Feuerbachians.&quot; At that time, some radical bourgeois in the Rhineland, who were in touch with the Left Hegelians, founded, in Cologne, an opposition paper called Rheinische Zeitung (The first issue appeared on January 1, 1842). Marx and Bruno Bauer were invited to be the chief contributors, and in October 1842 Marx became editor-in-chief and moved from Bonn to Cologne. The newspaper&apos;s revolutionary-democratic trend became more and more pronounced under Marx&apos;s editorship, and the government first imposed double and triple censorship on the paper, and then on January 1 1843 decided to suppress it. Marx had to resign the editorship before that date, but his resignation did not save the paper, which suspended publication in March 1843. Of the major articles Marx contributed to Rheinische Zeitung, Engels notes, in addition to those indicated below (see Bibliography), an article on the condition of peasant winegrowers in the Moselle Valley.[1] Marx&apos;s journalistic activities convinced him that he was insufficiently acquainted with political economy, and he zealously set out to study it. In 1843, Marx married, at Kreuznach, a childhood friend he had become engaged to while still a student. His wife came of a reactionary family of the Prussian nobility, her elder brother being Prussia&apos;s Minister of the Interior during a most reactionary period1850-58. In the autumn of 1843, Marx went to Paris in order to publish a radical journal abroad, together with Arnold Ruge (1802-1880); Left Hegelian; in prison in 1825-30; a political exile following 1848, and a Bismarckian after 1866-70). Only one issue of this journal, Deutsch-Franz\ufffdsische Jahrb\ufffdcher, appeared;[2] publication was discontinued owing to the difficulty of secretly distributing it in Germany, and to disagreement with Ruge. Marx&apos;s articles in this journal showed that he was already a revolutionary who advocated &quot;merciless criticism of everything existing&quot;, and in particular the &quot;criticism by weapon&quot;,[3] and appealed to the masses and to the proletariat. In September 1844, Frederick Engels came to Paris for a few days, and from that time on became Marx&apos;s closest friend. They both took a most active part in the then seething life of the revolutionary groups in Paris (of particular importance at the time was Proudhon&apos;s[4] doctrine), which Marx pulled to pieces in his Poverty of Philosophy, 1847); waging a vigorous struggle against the various doctrines of petty-bourgeois socialism, they worked out the theory and tactics of revolutionary proletarian socialism, or communism Marxism). See Marx&apos;s works of this period, 1844-48 in the Bibliography. At the insistent request of the Prussian government, Marx was banished from Paris in 1845, as a dangerous revolutionary. He went to Brussels. In the spring of 1847 Marx and Engels joined a secret propaganda society called the Communist League;[5] they took a prominent part in the League&apos;s Second Congress (London, November 1847), at whose request they drew up the celebrated Communist Manifesto, which appeared in February 1848. With the clarity and brilliance of genius, this work outlines a new world-conception, consistent with materialism, which also embrace the realm of social life; dialectics, as the most comprehensive and profound doctrine of development; the theory of the class struggle and of the world-historic revolutionary role of the proletariatthe creator of a new, communist society. On the outbreak of the Revolution of February 1848,[6] Marx was banished from Belgium. He returned to Paris, whence, after the March Revolution,[7] he went to Cologne, Germany, where Neue Rheinische Zeitung[8] was published from June 1, 1848, to May 19, 1849, with Marx as editor-in-chief. The new theory was splendidly confirmed by the course of the revolutionary events of 1848-49, just as it has been subsequently confirmed by all proletarian and democratic movements in all countries of the world. The victorious counter-revolution first instigated court proceedings against Marx (he was acquitted on February 9, 1849), and then banished him from Germany (May 16, 1849). First Marx went to Paris, was again banished after the demonstration of June 13, 1849,[9] and then went to London, where he lived until his death. His life as a political exile was a very hard one, as the correspondence between Marx and Engels (published in 1913) clearly reveals. Poverty weighed heavily on Marx and his family; had it not been for Engels&apos; constant and selfless financial aid, Marx would not only have been unable to complete Capital but would have inevitably have been crushed by want. Moreover, the prevailing doctrines and trends of petty-bourgeois socialism, and of non-proletarian socialism in general, forced Marx to wage a continuous and merciless struggle and sometime to repel the most savage and monstrous personal attacks (Herr Vogt).[10] Marx, who stood aloof from circles of political exiles, developed his materialist theory in a number of historical works (see Bibliography), devoting himself mainly to a study of political economy. Marx revolutionized science (see &quot;The Marxist Doctrine&quot;, below) in his Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy (1859) and Capital (Vol. I, 1867). The revival of the democratic movements in the late fifties and in the sixties recalled Marx to practical activity. In 1864 (September 28) the International Working Men&apos;s Associationthe celebrated First Internationalwas founded in London. Marx was the heart and soul of this organization, and author of its first Address[11] and of a host of resolutions, declaration and manifestoes. In uniting the labor movement of various forms of non-proletarian, pre-Marxist socialism (Mazzini, Proudhon, Bakunin, liberal trade-unionism in Britain, Lassallean vacillations to the right in Germany, etc.), and in combating the theories of all these sects and schools, Marx hammered out a uniform tactic for the proletarian struggle of the working in the various countries. Following the downfall of the Paris Commune (1871)of which gave such a profound, clear-cut, brilliant effective and revolutionary analysis (The Civil War In France, 1871)and the Bakunin-caused[12] cleavage in the International, the latter organization could no longer exist in Europe. After the Hague Congress of the International (1872), Marx had the General Council of the International had played its historical part, and now made way for a period of a far greater development of the labor movement in all countries in the world, a period in which the movement grew in scope, and mass socialist working-class parties in individual national states were formed. Marx&apos;s health was undermined by his strenuous work in the International and his still more strenuous theoretical occupations. He continued work on the refashioning of political economy and on the completion of Capital, for which he collected a mass of new material and studied a number of languages (Russian, for instance). However, ill-health prevented him from completing Capital. His wife died on December 2, 1881, and on March 14, 1883, Marx passed away peacefully in his armchair. He lies buried next to his wife at Highgate Cemetery in London. Of Marx&apos;s children some died in childhood in London, when the family were living in destitute circumstances. Three daughters married English and French socialists; Eleanor Aveling, Laura Lafargue and Jenny Longuet. The latter&apos;s son is a member of the French Socialist Party. The Marxist Doctrine Marxism is the system of Marx&apos;s views and teachings. Marx was the genius who continued and consummated the three main ideological currents of the 19th century, as represented by the three most advanced countries of mankind: classical German philosophy, classical English political economy, and French socialism combined with French revolutionary doctrines in general. Acknowledged even by his opponents, the remarkable consistency and integrity of Marx&apos;s views, whose totality constitutes modern materialism and modern scientific socialism, as the theory and program of the working-class movement in all the civilized countries of the world, make it incumbent on us to present a brief outline of his world-conception in general, prior to giving an exposition of the principal content of Marxism, namely, Marx&apos;s economic doctrine. Philosophical Materialism Beginning with the years 1844-45, when his views took shape, Marx was a materialist and especially a follower of Ludwig Feuerbach, whose weak point he subsequently saw only in his materialism being insufficiently consistent and comprehensive. To Marx, Feuerbach&apos;s historic and &quot;epoch-making&quot; significance lay in his having resolutely broken with Hegel&apos;s idealism and in his proclamation of materialism, which already &quot;in the 18th century, particularly French materialism, was not only a struggle against the existing political institutions and against... religion and theology, but also... against all metaphysics&quot; (in the sense of &quot;drunken speculation&quot; as distinct from &quot;sober philosophy&quot;). (The Holy Family, in Literarischer Nachlass[13]) &quot;To Hegel... ,&quot; wrote Marx, &quot;the process of thinking, which, under the name of the Idea&apos;, he even transforms into an independent subject, is the demiurgos (the creator, the maker) of the real world.... With me, on the contrary, the ideal is nothing else than the material world reflected by the human mind, and translated into forms of thought.&quot; (Capital, Vol. I, Afterward to the Second Edition.) In full conformity with this materialist philosophy of Marx&apos;s, and expounding it, Frederick Engels wrote in Anti-D\ufffdhring (read by Marx in the manuscript): &quot;The real unity of the world consists in its materiality, and this is proved... by a long and wearisome development of philosophy and natural science....&quot; &quot;Motion is the mode of existence of matter. Never anywhere has there been matter without motion, or motion without matter, nor can there be.... But if the... question is raised: what thought and consciousness really are, and where they come from; it becomes apparent that they are products of the human brain and that main himself is a product of Nature, which has developed in and along with its environment; hence it is self-evident that the products of the human brain, being in the last analysis also products of Nature, do not contradict the rest of Nature&apos;s interconnections but are in correspondence with them.... &quot;Hegel was an idealist, that is to say, the thoughts within his mind were to him not the more or less abstract images [Abbilder, reflections; Engels sometimes speaks of &quot;imprints&quot;] of real things and processes, but on the contrary, things and their development were to him only the images, made real, of the &quot;Idea&quot; existing somewhere or other before the world existed.&quot; In his Ludwig Feuerbachwhich expounded his own and Marx&apos;s views on Feuerbach&apos;s philosophy, and was sent to the printers after he had re-read an old manuscript Marx and himself had written in 1844-45 on Hegel, Feuerbach and the materialist conception of historyEngels wrote: &quot;The great basic question of all philosophy, especially of more recent philosophy, is the relation of thinking and being... spirit to Nature... which is primary, spirit or Nature.... The answers which the philosophers gave to this question split them into two great camps. Those who asserted the primary of spirit to Nature and, therefore, in the last instance, assumed world creation in some form or other... comprised the camp of idealism. The others, who regarded Nature as primary, belonged to the various schools of materialism.&quot; Any other use of the concepts of (philosophical) idealism and materialism leads only to confusion. Marx decidedly rejected, not only idealism, which is always linked in one way or another with religion, but also the viewsespecially widespread in our dayof Hume and Kant, agnosticism, criticism, and positivism[14] in their various forms; he considered that philosophy a &quot;reactionary&quot; concession to idealism, and at best a &quot;shame-faced way of surreptitiously accepting materialism, while denying it before the world.&quot;[15] On this question, see, besides the works by Engels and Marx mentioned above, a letter Marx wrote to Engels on December 12, 1868, in which, referring to an utterance by the naturalist Thomas Huxley, which was &quot;more materialistic&quot; than usual, and to his recognition that &quot;as long as we actually observe and think, we cannot possibly get away from materialism&quot;, Marx reproached Huxley for leaving a &quot;loop hole&quot; for agnosticism, for Humism. It is particularly important to note Marx&apos;s view on the relation between freedom and necessity: &quot;Freedom is the appreciation of necessity. Necessity is blind only insofar as it is not understood.&apos;&quot; (Engels in Anti-D\ufffdhring) This means recognition of the rule of objective laws in Nature and of the dialectical transformation of necessity into freedom (in the same manner as the transformation of the uncognized but cognizable &quot;thing-in-itself&quot; into the &quot;thing-for-us&quot;, of the &quot;essence of things&quot; into &quot;phenomena&quot;). Marx and Engels considered that the &quot;old&quot; materialism, including that of Feuerbach (and still more the &quot;vulgar&quot; materialism of Buchner, Vogt and Moleschott), contained the following major shortcomings: 1) this materialism was &quot;predominantly mechanical,&quot; failing to take account of the latest developments in chemistry and biology (today it would be necessary to add: and in the electrical theory of matter); 2) the old materialism was non-historical and non-dialectical (metaphysical, in the meaning of anti-dialectical), and did not adhere consistently and comprehensively to the standpoint of development; 3) it regarded the &quot;human essence&quot; in the abstract, not as the &quot;complex of all&quot; (concretely and historically determined) &quot;social relations&quot;, and therefore merely &quot;interpreted&quot; the world, whereas it was a question of &quot;changing&quot; it, i.e., it did not understand the importance of &quot;revolutionary practical activity&quot;. Dialectics As the most comprehensive and profound doctrine of development, and the richest in content, Hegelian dialectics was considered by Marx and Engels the greatest achievement of classical German philosophy. They thought that any other formulation of the principle of development, of evolution, was one-sided and poor in content, and could only distort and mutilate the actual course of development (which often proceeds by leaps, and via catastrophes and revolutions) in Nature and in society. &quot;Marx and I were pretty well the only people to rescue conscious dialectics [from the destruction of idealism, including Hegelianism] and apply it in the materialist conception of Nature.... Nature is the proof of dialectics, and it must be said for modern natural science that it has furnished extremely rich [this was written before the discovery of radium, electrons, the transmutation of elements, etc.!] and daily increasing materials for this test, and has thus proved that in the last analysis Nature&apos;s process is dialectical and not metaphysical. &quot; The great basic thought,&quot; Engels writes, &quot;that the world is not to be comprehended as a complex of ready-made things, but as a complex of processes, in which the things apparently stable no less than their mind images in our heads, the concepts, go through an uninterrupted change of coming into being and passing away... this great fundamental thought has, especially since the time of Hegel, so thoroughly permeated ordinary consciousness that in this generality it is now scarcely ever contradicted. But to acknowledge this fundamental thought in words and to apply it in reality in detail to each domain of investigation are two different things.... For dialectical philosophy nothing is final, absolute, sacred. It reveals the transitory character of everything and in everything; nothing can endure before it except the uninterrupted process of becoming and of passing away, of endless ascendancy from the lower to the higher. And dialectical philosophy itself is nothing more than the mere reflection of this process in the thinking brain.&quot; Thus, according to Marx, dialectics is &quot;the science of the general laws of motion, both of the external world and of human thought.&quot;[16] This revolutionary aspect of Hegel&apos;s philosophy was adopted and developed by Marx. Dialectical materialism &quot;does not need any philosophy standing above the other sciences.&quot; From previous philosophy there remains &quot;the science of thought and its lawsformal logic and dialectics.&quot; Dialectics, as understood by Marx, and also in conformity with Hegel, includes what is now called the theory of knowledge, or epistemology, studying and generalizing the original and development of knowledge, the transition from non-knowledge to knowledge. In our times, the idea of development, of evolution, has almost completely penetrated social consciousness, only in other ways, and not through Hegelian philosophy. Still, this idea, as formulated by Marx and Engels on the basis of Hegel&apos;s&apos; philosophy, is far more comprehensive and far richer in content than the current idea of evolution is. A development that repeats, as it were, stages that have already been passed, but repeats them in a different way, on a higher basis (&quot;the negation of the negation&quot;), a development, so to speak, that proceeds in spirals, not in a straight line; a development by leaps, catastrophes, and revolutions; &quot;breaks in continuity&quot;; the transformation of quantity into quality; inner impulses towards development, imparted by the contradiction and conflict of the various forces and tendencies acting on a given body, or within a given phenomenon, or within a given society; the interdependence and the closest and indissoluble connection between all aspects of any phenomenon (history constantly revealing ever new aspects), a connection that provides a uniform, and universal process of motion, one that follows definite lawsthese are some of the features of dialectics as a doctrine of development that is richer than the conventional one. (Cf. Marx&apos;s letter to Engels of January 8, 1868, in which he ridicules Stein&apos;s &quot;wooden trichotomies,&quot; which it would be absurd to confuse with materialist dialectics.) The Materialist Conception of History A realization of the inconsistency, incompleteness, and one-sidedness of the old materialism convinced Marx of the necessity of &quot;bringing the science of society... into harmony with the materialist foundation, and of reconstructing it thereupon.&quot;[17] Since materialism in general explains consciousness as the outcome of being, and not conversely, then materialism as applied to the social life of mankind has to explain social consciousness as the outcome of social being. &quot;Technology,&quot; Marx writes (Capital, Vol. I), &quot;discloses man&apos;s mode of dealing with Nature, the immediate process of production by which he sustains his life, and thereby also lays bare the mode of formation of his social relations, and of the mental conceptions that flow from them.&quot;[18] In the preface to his Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Marx gives an integral formulation of the fundamental principles of materialism as applied to human society and its history, in the following words: &quot;In the social production of their life, men enter into definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will, relations of production which correspond to a definite stage of development of their material productive forces. &quot;The sum total of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which rises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the social, political and intellectual life process in general. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of their development, the material productive forces of society come in conflict with the existing relations of production, orwhat is but a legal expression for the same thingwith the property relations within which they have been at work hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relation turn into their fetters. Then begins an epoch of social revolution. With the change of the economic foundation the entire immense superstructure is more or less rapidly transformed. In considering such transformations a distinction should always be made between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, aesthetic or philosophicin short, ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out. &quot;Just as our opinion of an individual is not based on what he thinks of himself, so we cannot judge of such a period of transformation by its own consciousness; on the contrary, this consciousness must be explained rather from the contradictions of material life, from the existing conflict between the social productive forces and the relations of production.... In broad outlines, Asiatic, ancient, feudal, and modern bourgeois modes of production can be designated as progressive epochs in the economic formation of society.&quot;[19] [Cf. Marx&apos;s brief formulation in a letter to Engels dated July 7, 1866: &quot;Our theory that the organization of labor is determined by the means of production.&quot;] The discovery of the materialist conception of history, or more correctly, the consistent continuation and extension of materialism into the domain of social phenomena, removed the two chief shortcomings in earlier historical theories. In the first place, the latter at best examined only the ideological motives in the historical activities of human beings, without investigating the origins of those motives, or ascertaining the objective laws governing the development of the system of social relations, or seeing the roots of these relations in the degree of development reached by material production; in the second place, the earlier theories did not embrace the activities of the masses of the population, whereas historical materialism made it possible for the first time to study with scientific accuracy the social conditions of the life of the masses, and the changes in those conditions. At best, pre-Marxist &quot;sociology&quot; and historiography brought forth an accumulation of raw facts, collected at random, and a description of individual aspects of the historical process. By examining the totality of opposing tendencies, by reducing them to precisely definable conditions of life and production of the various classes of individual aspects of the historical process. By examining the choice of a particular &quot;dominant&quot; idea or in its interpretation, and by revealing that, without exception, all ideas and all the various tendencies stem from the condition of the material forces of production, Marxism indicated the way to an all-embracing and comprehensive study of the process of the rise, development, and decline of socio-economic systems. People make their own history but what determines the motives of people, of the mass of peoplei.e., what is the sum total of all these clashes in the mass of human societies? What are the objective conditions of production of material life that form the basis of all man&apos;s historical activity? What is the law of development of these conditions? To all these Marx drew attention and indicated the way to a scientific study of history as a single process which, with all its immense variety and contradictoriness, is governed by definite laws. The Class Struggle It is common knowledge that, in any given society, the striving of some of its members conflict with the strivings of others, that social life is full of contradictions, and that history reveals a struggle between nations and societies, as well as within nations and societies, and, besides, an alternation of periods of revolution and reaction, peace and war, stagnation and rapid progress or decline. Marxism has provided the guidance i.e., the theory of the class strugglefor the discovery of the laws governing this seeming maze and chaos. It is only a study of the sum of the strivings of all the members of a given society or group of societies that can lead to a scientific definition of the result of those strivings. Now the conflicting strivings stem from the difference in the position and mode of life of the classes into which each society is divided. &quot;The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles,&quot; Marx wrote in the Communist Manifesto (with the exception of the history of the primitive community, Engels added subsequently). &quot;Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstruction of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.... The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.&quot; Ever since the Great French Revolution, European history has, in a number of countries, tellingly revealed what actually lies at the bottom of eventsthe struggle of classes. The Restoration period in France[20] already produced a number of historians (Thierry, Guizot, Mignet, and Thiers) who, in summing up what was taking place, were obliged to admit that the class struggle was taking place, were obliged to admit that the class struggle was the key to all French history. The modern periodthat of complete victory of the bourgeoisie, representative institutions, extensive (if not universal) suffrage, a cheap daily press that is widely circulated among the masses, etc., a period of powerful and every-expanding unions of workers and unions of employers, etc.has shown even more strikingly (though sometimes in a very one-sided, &quot;peaceful&quot;, and &quot;constitutional&quot; form) the class struggle as the mainspring of events.

Celebrating it with one\u2019s family is so important that even six months ahead of Christmas it is virtually impossible to get a flight from Ireland to Lithuania, and everyone is anxiously expecting new flights to be announced, claims Arknas Tei\u0161erskis, director of the Lithuanian Association of Ireland (LBA). Not everyone goes home, though, and the availability of eastern European shops in Ireland makes it easier for Lithuanians to celebrate here. Tei\u0161erskis himself is preparing his Dublin home for a traditional Lithuanian Christmas dinner. \u201cThis year my mother is coming to Ireland for Christmas,\u201d he says. \u201cShe wants to see her grandchildren.\u201d A traditional Christmas dinner in Lithuania consists of no less than 12 dishes or courses, all of them totally devoid of meat or milk. \u201cChristmas Eve is the last day of lent,\u201d explains Tei\u0161erskis. \u201cWe\u2019re not allowed to eat meat or milk products, so most of the dishes are from vegetables, fruit, mushrooms and such. Sometimes you\u2019d have fish. You don\u2019t have to eat all the food, but you have to try every dish that\u2019s on the table.\u201d A Lithuanian Christmas is never complete without one thing \u2013 traditional sugar-free biscuits covered with \u2018poppy milk\u2019. \u201cThey\u2019re called Ku iukai [Koo-choo-kai],\u201d says Tei\u0161erskis. \u201cThey\u2019re cylindrical in shape. Traditionally you\u2019d pour poppy milk over them just like you pour normal milk over cereal.\u201d Poppy milk can be produced by simply grating poppy seeds and adding some hot water. Both the seeds and the biscuits are sold in eastern European shops across Ireland. The dinner itself only starts after the first star appears in the sky, and Lithuanians do not normally clean the table after the meal. \u201cIf you clean the table after Christmas dinner you will have bad luck in the next year \u2013 that\u2019s what they say, anyway,\u201d says Tei\u0161erskis. \u201cYou\u2019re meant to leave all the food on the table until next morning and then have breakfast with the leftovers. Only then can you take the food away.\u201d Lithuanians also have many traditional divinations which are practiced on Christmas Eve. One tradition involves laying a small heap of hay on the dinner table before covering it with a tablecloth and serving the food. Then at dinner, the family members take turns to take straws from under the tablecloth \u2013 the longer the straw, the longer you will live, according to an ancient belief. Another divination involves unmarried girls going to a barn and taking as many logs as they can carry. They then bring the logs into the house and count them. If the number is even, then \u2013 as tradition has it \u2013 the girl will get married in the next year. Will Tei\u0161erskis\u2019s family practice any of these ancient Lithuanian customs? \u201cNot really,\u201d he replies. \u201cMy eldest daughter is just 12. Besides, it\u2019s hard to find logs in Dublin.

Blair served in the Navy for 34 years. He was chief of U.S. Pacific Command during the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and crafted what many intelligence and military officials say was an effective international counterterrorism strategy in southeast Asia, where U.S. efforts along with foreign partners are credited with diminishing terrorist groups such as Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiyah. Blair is also a China expert, and he was an associate director for military support at the CIA. Blair would replace Michael McConnell, who resigned the post Tuesday after nearly two years in the job.

However, by early 1838 further conflicts arose between them. In March 1838, Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon moved to Far West, which had been under the presidency of Cowdery&apos;s brothers-in-law, David and John Whitmer. Smith and Rigdon took charge of the Missouri church and initiated a number of policies which Cowdery and the Whitmers felt violated the separation of church and state. On April 12, 1838, a church court excommunicated Cowdery after he failed to appear at a hearing on his membership and sent a letter resigning from the Church instead. The Whitmers, W.W. Phelps and Book of Mormon witness Hiram Page were also cut off from the church. (Far West Record, pp. 165-66). According to church records, Cowdery was cut off for inactivity, accusing Smith of adultery due to Smith&apos;s secretive practice of plural marriage, to which Cowdery was opposed and three charges of beginning law practice and seeking to collect debts after the Kirtland bank failure. Cowdery and the Whitmers became known as &quot;the dissenters,&quot; but they continued to live in and around Far West, where they owned a great deal of property. Fervent members of the Church including Sampson Avard, Lyman Wight and Hyrum Smith organized a confraternity which became known as the &quot;Danites&quot; whose first stated goal was to expel the &quot;dissenters.&quot; On June 17, 1838, President Sidney Rigdon announced to a large Mormon congregation that the dissenters were &quot;as salt that had lost its savor&quot; and that it was the duty of the faithful to cast the dissenters out &quot;to be trodden beneath the feet of men.&quot; Cowdery and the Whitmers took this Salt Sermon as a threat against their lives and fled the county. Reports of their treatment was one of the early factors which led to the Mormon War. Life apart from the Church From 18381848, Cowdery put the Latter Day Saint church behind him. He began to study law, passed the bar and began to practice law in Tiffin, Ohio. While in Tiffin, Oliver gained a reputation as an excellent lawyer, educator and political figure. In 1840, he was selected as editor of the local Democratic newspaper until it was learned that he was one of the Book of Mormon witnesses. Rather than recant his testimony, he was demoted to assistant editor. In 1846, Cowdery was nominated as his district&apos;s Democratic party candidate for the state senate. However, when his Mormon background was discovered, he was defeated. Later Latter Day Saint Contacts After Joseph Smith was assassinated, Cowdery&apos;s brother Lyman recognized James J. Strang as Smith&apos;s successor to the church presidency. In 1847, Oliver moved to Elkhorn, Wisconsin near Strang&apos;s headquarters in Voree and went into law practice with his brother. He became co-editor of the Walworth County Democrat and in 1848 he ran for state assemblyman. However, his Mormon ties were once again discovered and he was defeated. In 1848, Cowdery traveled to meet with followers of Brigham Young and the Quorum of the Twelve who were encamped at Winter Quarters, Nebraska. On November 12, 1848, Oliver was rebaptized into the LDS church by Elder Orson Hyde of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He acknowledged the authority of the leaders of the church as presently constituted. Cowdery developed a respiratory illness and on March 3, 1850 he died in Whitmer&apos;s home in Richmond, Missouri.

He entered (1911) West Point and graduated in 1915. In 1916 he married Mamie Geneva Doud. In World War I, Eisenhower was commanding officer at Camp Colt, Gettysburg, Pa., a training camp for the new U.S. Army tank corps. After the war he was stationed (192224) in the Panama Canal Zone, was a member of the American Battle Monuments Commission, and was assistant executive (192933) in the office of the Assistant Secretary of War. From 1935 to 1940 he was in the Philippines, where he served as an aide to Douglas MacArthur. General during World War II Eisenhower&apos;s impressive performance in the 1941 army maneuvers led to his assignment in Washington, D.C. as chief of operations (1942) and preceded his meteoric rise to the top as Allied military commander of World War II. In June, 1942, General Eisenhower was named U.S. commander of the European theater of operations. He commanded U.S. forces in the North African landings (Nov., 1942) and in Feb., 1943, became chief of all Allied forces in North Africa. After successfully directing the invasions of Sicily (July, 1943) and Italy (Sept.), he was called (Dec.) to England to be supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force. He was largely responsible for the cooperation between the British, American, and other forces and for the integration of land, sea, and air forces in the great battle for the European continent. His own account of the Allied defeat of Germany was published in book form as Crusade in Europe (1948). In Dec., 1944, he was made general of the army (five-star general), and in 1945 he commanded the U.S. occupation forces in Germany. In Nov., 1945, he became chief of staff of the U.S. Army and advocated the unification of the U.S. armed forces and universal military training. He resigned (Feb., 1948) as chief of staff to become (June) president of Columbia Univ. Presidency Eisenhower was sought as a nominee for presidency of the United States in 1948 but rejected the offers made him. In Dec., 1950, he obtained a leave of absence as president of Columbia to become Supreme Allied Commander, Europe (SACEUR). After he negotiated basic commitments from member countries to build up the forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, he retired from active duty (1952) with the army to campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. With the support of Republican liberals and internationalists, he defeated his chief rival, Senator Robert A. Taft, for the nomination. His popularity as a World War II hero, and his promise to end the Korean War brought Eisenhower an easy victory over his Democratic opponent, Adlai E. Stevenson, and he took office on Jan. 20, 1953. First Term Eisenhower soon fulfilled his campaign pledge when an armistice was signed (July, 1953) in Korea after he threatened to use nuclear weapons. Eisenhower and his secretary of state John Foster Dulles continued the Truman administration policy of containing Communism and of financing the French attempt to maintain control of Indochina. Defense treaties were signed with South Korea (1953) and Taiwan (1954), and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization was formed in 1954 to halt Communist expansion in Asia. After the French lost the battle of Dienbienphu and withdrew from Indochina, Eisenhower sent military aid to South Vietnam. He also tried, after the death of Soviet leader Josef Stalin in 1953, to ease cold war tensions. His &quot;atoms for peace&quot; plan and his statements at the Geneva summit conference in July, 1955, were widely heralded. At home, Eisenhower&apos;s record was less distinguished. He failed to oppose publicly Sen. Joe McCarthy. The predominance of business executives in his cabinet lent a conservative tone to his administration, while his concern for a balanced budget at a time when defense expenditures were rising rapidly, as well as his commitment to limiting the role of the government in the economy, kept Eisenhower from expanding the social welfare programs begun by his Democratic predecessors. Despite an attack of coronary thrombosis in Sept., 1955, he was reelected over Adlai Stevenson in 1956 by an even wider margin than in 1952. Second Term During his second term, desegregation became one of the primary issues on the national agenda. Although personally unenthusiastic about desegregation, he sent federal troops to Little Rock, Ark. to enforce a court-ordered school desegregation decision (Sept., 1957). His administration supported the civil-rights legislation that passed Congress (1957, 1960); and he prohibited discriminatory practices in the District of Columbia and in federal facilities such as navy yards and hospitals. International tensions increased during his second term. In 1957 he promulgated the so-called Eisenhower Doctrine, in which he proposed to send military and economic aid to any Middle Eastern nation requesting it in order to bolster that region against Communist aggression. Pursuant to that doctrine, he sent U.S. Marines to Lebanon in July, 1958. Eisenhower hosted Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev during the latter&apos;s visit to the United States in 1959. When they met at the Paris summit conference in the following year, the tone was less friendly; Khrushchev denounced Eisenhower for permitting high-altitude espionage flights over the Soviet Union and walked out of the summit. Fidel Castro&apos;s Communist regime in Cuba exacerbated cold war tensions, and In 1961, Eisenhower broke diplomatic relations with Cuba and authorized preparations for an invasion (see Bay of Pigs Invasion). Later Years In his farewell address as president, Eisenhower warned against the influence of the growing &quot;military-industrial complex.&quot; After leaving the White House, he remained generally aloof from politics, although he did occasionally comment on national issues and campaign for Republican candidates. In 1962 the Eisenhower presidential library was dedicated at Abilene, Kans.

When his mangled body was carried down from Pine Mountain, Georgia, on a litter, Private Sam Watkins of the 1st Tennessee noted that the bishop-general was \u2018as white as a piece of marble,\u2019 and \u2018not a drop of blood was ever seen to come out of the place through which the cannon ball had passed.\u2019 But plenty of blood had been spilled \u2014 advancing Union soldiers found the Georgia clay soaked with it the next day, along with a note reportedly staked by a ramrod into the ground nearby: \u2018You damned Yankee sons of bitches have killed our old Gen. Polk.\u2019 It was a sudden and gruesome end to a controversial military career. From the outset, Polk was vilified in Northern newspapers and in some religious circles for \u2018buckling the sword over the gown,\u2019 as he put it, and leading armed men in rebellion against their government. In contrast, other members of the American clergy either fanned or fought the flames of secession from the safety of their pulpits \u2014 or steadfastly avoided the thorny moral issues of war and slavery altogether. William H. De Lancey, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, wrote a letter to President Abraham Lincoln demanding with all the certainty and condescension of a Sunday school lesson that the church\u2019s bishops and priests be exempted from any draft. \u2018[I]t is contrary to their consciences as officers of Christ\u2019s kingdom to bear arms as soldiers and shed blood,\u2019 De Lancey said, reminding Lincoln of Christ\u2019s warning at Gethsemane: \u2018They that take the sword shall perish with the sword.\u2019 Leonidas Polk had no such qualms. He led men in battle on fields from Missouri to Georgia, a Christian soldier in a gold-buttoned gray uniform. \u2018The Lord rewards them according to their works,\u2019 he said, summing up his view of the matter in an 1863 letter to his brother. But whatever his works and his ultimate reward, Polk would indeed perish with the sword. \u2018A Man of High Social Position\u2019 Leonidas Polk was born in Raleigh, N.C., on April 10, 1806, the son and grandson of Tarheel heroes of the Revolutionary War. His father William was a member of the North Carolina General Assembly and a trustee of the University of North Carolina, and young Leonidas would enjoy all the advantages that wealth and family connections could provide. Among these was a commission to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, where he graduated eighth in the class of 1827. His roommate at the academy was Albert Sidney Johnston, and he became close friends with a cadet from Mississippi two years his junior, Jefferson Davis. Another classmate, Robert E. Lee, would later write that Polk was considered by officers and cadets alike \u2018as a model for all that was soldierly, gentlemanly, and honorable.\u2019"], "triple": ["Leonidas Polk", "was born in", "Raleigh"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "Raleigh,_North_Carolina", "subject": "Lieutenant_General"}, "_id": 63161, "nouns": [["PERSON", "Polk"], ["GPE", "Raleigh"], ["PERSON", "Leonidas"]]}

With the publication of The Davidian Massacre and her introduction to the republication of Karl Hess&apos; Community Technology (both of which have 1995 copyrights), she is focusing on a slightly different area the importance that some of us find in a commitment to community living, and the hostility that others have to these communities. The Davidian Massacre is an eye-opening expos\u00e9 of government wrong-doing and Community Technology is a libertarian classic that has been too long out of print, but both books are important reading. Not just for libertarians, but for all those who wonder what inspires the libertarian dedication to nongovernmental solutions. Mount Carmel Center at Waco, Texas, was founded in the 1960s in a group of ramshackle houses by Ben and Lois Roden as an offshoot of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, the &quot;Branch Davidians.&quot; In 1981, 22-year-old Vernon Wayne Howell, a self-taught student of the Bible, came there seeking a prophet. He became the leading contender for the role of prophet himself after the Rodens died. His rival, George Roden, drove him out at gun point in 1984, but most of the Davidians left with him. There were years of conflict and even a gun battle between Howell and Roden, who owned Mount Carmel Center, ending in the Spring of 1988 when Howell and his Davidian followers paid 16 years of back taxes on Mount Carmel (after Roden went to jail for threatening a judge) and repossessed it under an agreement with the county that they would finally own the property if they occupied and paid taxes on it for five years. Carol Moore points out that &quot;significantly, that five-year period would end during the 1993 siege.&quot; She postulates that one of the main reasons that the Davidians were reluctant to surrender to the authorities and leave the property during the siege was a fear that by giving up occupancy they would forfeit their property to the county. In 1990, Vernon Howell legally changed his name to David Koresh. In 1991, the Davidians started tearing down separate homes at the center and building one large building where the community would live and study together. In 1992, Davidians from all over the world came to the Center to celebrate Passover Koresh&apos;s preaching centered on prophecies of the Apocalypse, and he said this might be the last Passover. The group was unconventional in other ways; beginning in 1989, Koresh had taken a number of women in the community as his wives, including some teenagers, saying that he was acting on God&apos;s command. Not everyone agreed with Koresh&apos;s leadership. Between 1990 and 1993, according to Moore, &quot;as many as twenty former members made various allegations to the government and press,&quot; including tax fraud, stashing of weapons, sexual goings on, violation of immigration laws (a number of Koresh&apos;s followers came from Australia, Canada, the Philippines, New Zealand, and England), and &quot;exposing children to explicit talk about sex and violence.&quot; Many of these charges were orchestrated by Marc Breault, a former Davidian who left the group to become a &quot;cult buster.&quot; As a result, the Center was investigated by social workers in 1992 for child abuse (the charges were dropped for lack of proof), the television program &quot;A Current Affair&quot; filmed an expos\u00e9, and various federal agencies received complaints. Perhaps because of such investigations, Koresh became convinced that the Apocalypse would begin with an attack on Mount Carmel Center. For protection, the group not only built an underground tornado shelter but reinforced the front wall of the new building with an additional two-foot high concrete wall and built a concrete room to house the Center&apos;s guns. The community ran several businesses, including a profitable legal gun business, using a licensed dealer who was not a member of the church. Among other trades, they invested in a large number of legal semi-automatic weapons, assuming that a profit could be made on their resale if the government restricted their manufacture in the future. Most of these were kept in boxes and had never been fired. This activity brought them to the attention of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) as early as July of 1992. When he was informed at that time that the BATF was questioning the gun dealer about possible illegal weapons at the Center, Koresh invited the agents to come there and inspect his weapons, an invitation that was refused. Despite its defectors, Mount Carmel Center was not falling apart as a community when agents from the BATF stormed it at the end of February 1993, supposedly to serve a warrant for David Koresh&apos;s arrest. It was a self-supporting, interracial, family community of men, women, and children united by unconventional religious and sexual ideas. It was a community that had cooperated with investigative authorities, who had not been able to find any evidence of child abuse or illegal weapons, two of the main charges later asserted in the media. And it was a community whose lives and property were then destroyed by agents of the federal government. The Davidian Massacre is an invaluable resource book, detailing day by day, sometimes minute by minute, the events that led up to the first attack by the BATF, the attack, the ensuing siege by BATF and FBI agents, the final destruction of the center by government forces using tanks aa&gt;"], "triple": ["Vernon Howell", "legally changed his name to", "David Koresh"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "David_Koresh", "subject": "David_Koresh"}, "_id": 110465, "nouns": [["PERSON", "Howell"], ["PERSON", "David Koresh"], ["PERSON", "Vernon"]]}

Harding 29 29. Warren G. Harding - one of the best liked men of the generation, he was spineless and a bad judge of character. He is compared to Grant because his term in office was scandalous. Many corporations could expand, antitrust laws were ingnored, and he achieved disarmament with the Open Door in China. The tariff increased also. He died on August 2, 1923 of pneumonia and thrombosis while making speeches. Charles Evan Hughes 30 He was the Republican governor of New York who ran for the presidency in 1916. He lost to Wilson. He was a strong reformer who gained his national fame as an investigator of malpractices in gas and insurance companies. In 1921 he became Harding&apos;s Secretary of State. He called together the major powers to the Washington Disarmament Conference in 1921. Andrew Mellon 31 He was the Secretary of the Treasury during the 1920s and under Harding that had the theory that high taxes forced the rich to invest in tax-exempt securities rather than in factories that provided prosperous payrolls. He had followers in his theory called Mellonites. He helped engineer a series of tax reductions and reduced national debt by $10 billion. He was accused of indirectly encouraging the bull market and starting the descent into the stock market crash. Some people, however, believed he was the &quot;greatest secretary of treasury since Hamilton.&quot; He used &quot;trickle-down&quot; economics. Herbert Hoover 32 The president of the United States from 1929 to 1932 He was a republican who ran on a campaign of prohibition and prosperity. The early years of his presidency brought about a great deal of prosperity for the United States. Many people blamed him for the stock market crash. Albert B. Fall 33 He was Secretery of the Interior during Harding&apos;s administration, and was a scheming anticonservationist. He was convicted of leasing naval oil reserves and collecting bribes, which was called the Tea Pot Dome scandal. Harry M. Daugherty 34 Attorney General during the 1922 strike against the Railroad Labor Board. The strike ended when Daugherty stopped the strikers in one of the most sweeping injuctions in American history. He was a member of Harding&apos;s Ohio Gang. He was accused of the illegal sale of pardons and liquor permits. He was forced to resign. He was tried but a jury failed to convict him. Charles R. Forbes 35 In 1923 he resigned as head of the Veteran&apos;s Bureau. He swindled $200 million from the government in building Veteran&apos;s hospitals. He was sentenced to two years in the penitentiary. This was part of the Harding scandal and the &quot;Ohio gang&quot; Calvin Coolidge 36 became president when Harding died of pneumonia. He was known for practicing a rigid economy in money and words, and acquired the name &quot;Silent Cal&quot; for being so soft-spoken. He was a true republican and industrialist. Believed in the government supporting big business. John W. Davis 37 John W. Davis: Democratic convention nominee in 1924 against Coolidge. He was a wealthy lawyer connected with J.P. Morgan and Company. Coolidge easily defeated Davis. Robert La Follette 38 A senator from Wisconsin who ran for the presidency of 1924 on the Progressive party&apos;s ticket.

The Israeli army said its soldiers came under fire from militants hiding in the school and responded. It accused Gaza&apos;s Hamas rulers of &quot;cynically&quot; using civilians as human shields. Residents confirmed the account, saying militants were seen staging attacks from the area. Despite international criticism over civilian deaths and a diplomatic push to broker a cease-fire, Israeli said it would push on with the offensive against Hamas. Israeli ground forces edged closer to two major Gaza towns, and a total of 70 Palestinians were killed Tuesday \u2014 with just two confirmed as militants, health officials in Gaza said. A top U.N. official called for an investigation into the civilian death toll. Past Israeli ground offensives have been cut short when an errant shell or missile hit a civilian center, leading to international outcries that forced Israel to stand down. The shelling Tuesday in the northern town of Jebaliya marked the second time in hours a U.N. school came under attack; three people were killed in an attack on another U.N. school in Gaza City on Monday night. Tuesday&apos;s assault was the deadliest since Israel sent ground forces into Gaza last weekend as part of a larger offensive against Hamas that has killed more than 600 Palestinians, according to local hospital officials. Nearly half of the dead are civilians, according to U.N. and Palestinian officials. &quot;There&apos;s nowhere safe in Gaza. Everyone here is terrorized and traumatized,&quot; John Ging, the top U.N. official in Gaza, said after the Monday night attack on the compound of a U.N. school. The school has served as a shelter for refugees fleeing the 11-day offensive. A Palestinian rocket \u2014 one of two dozen fired from Gaza on Tuesday \u2014 wounded an Israeli infant. Dr. Bassam Abu Warda, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, said 36 people were killed in the Israeli strike on the U.N. school in Jebaliya. The United Nations confirmed 30 were killed and 55 injured by tank shells. In a statement, the Israeli army said an initial investigation found that &quot;mortar shells were fired from within the school at IDF soldiers. The force responded with mortars at the source of fire. The Hamas cynically uses civilians as human shields.&quot; The army said two Hamas militants \u2014 Imad Abu Askar and Hasan Abu Askar \u2014 were among the dead. Two neighborhood residents confirmed the Israeli account, saying a group of militants fired mortars from a street near the school, then fled into a crowd of people in the streets. Israel then opened fire. The residents, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared for their safety, said the Abu Askar brothers were known low-level Hamas militants. The attack occurred at mid-afternoon, when many people were out and about. Many people apparently stepped outside the shelter to get some air, thinking an area around a school was safe. Palestinian militants frequently fire from residential areas. However, Mohammed Nassar, a medic who treated the wounded, said he saw no gunmen among the casualties. Footage broadcast on Hamas&apos; Al Aqsa TV showed gruesome scenes at the hospital. At first, medics carried in at least five younger boys who were laid out on the hospital floor. It was not clear whether they were alive. Other medics then started unloading bodies of men who had been stacked up in the back of an ambulance, three high, and were dragged without stretchers. One man&apos;s legs had been turned into bloody stumps that dragged on the ground as he was pulled from the ambulance. The emergency room was packed, with all beds occupied and barely a patch of ground unoccupied by either a body or a doctor. In other rooms, there were bloodstains and bodies on the floor. Medics ran in to take pulses. &quot;I saw a lot of women and children wheeled in,&quot; said Fares Ghanem, another hospital official. &quot;A lot of the wounded were missing limbs and a lot of the dead were in pieces.&quot; Majed Hamdan, an AP photographer, said he rushed to the scene shortly after the attacks. At the hospital, he said, many children were among the dead. &quot;I saw women and men \u2014 parents \u2014 slapping their faces in grief, screaming, some of them collapsed to the floor. They knew their children were dead,&quot; he said. &quot;In the morgue, most of the killed appeared to be children. In the hospital, there wasn&apos;t enough space for the wounded.&quot; He said there were marks of five separate explosions, all in the area near the school. U.N. officials say they provided their location coordinates to Israel&apos;s army to ensure their buildings in Gaza are not targeted. Speaking shortly after the first attack, Maxwell Gaylard, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, demanded an investigation. &quot;As one of the most densely populated places in the world, it is clear that more civilians will be killed,&quot; he said. &quot;These tragic incidents need to be investigated, and if international humanitarian law has been contravened, those responsible must held accountable.&quot; In Britain, Prime Minister Gordon Brown called it &quot;the darkest moment yet for the Middle East.&quot; He said he had been in touch with world leaders, including from Egypt and Turkey, to discuss ways to forge a cease-fire. Israel launched its offensive on Dec. 27 to halt repeated Palestinian rocket attacks on its southern towns. After a weeklong air campaign, Israeli ground forces invaded Gaza over the weekend. Ten Israelis have died since the operation began, including a soldier who was shot on Tuesday. United Nations staff estimate around 15,000 people have fled to 23 U.N.-run schools they have turned into makeshift shelters. U.N. food aid has halted in the northern Gaza Strip because officials fear residents would risk their lives to reach distribution centers. Tanks rumbled closer to the towns of Khan Younis and Dir el Balah in south and central Gaza but were still several kilometers (miles) outside, witnesses said, adding that the sounds of fighting could be heard from around the Israeli positions. Israel has encircled Gaza City, the area&apos;s biggest city. The civilian death toll has drawn international condemnations and raised concerns of a humanitarian disaster. Many Gazans are without electricity or running water, thousands have been displaced from their homes and residents say food supplies are running thin. &quot;This is not a crisis, it&apos;s a disaster,&quot; said water utility official Munzir Shiblak. &quot;We are not even able to respond to the cry of the people.&quot; He said about 800,000 residents in Gaza City and northern parts of the territory had no access to running water from Tuesday. Gaza&apos;s overall population is 1.4 million people. Israel says it won&apos;t stop the assault until its southern towns are freed of the threat of Palestinian rocket fire and it receives international guarantees that Hamas, a militant group backed by Iran and Syria, will not restock its weapons stockpile. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said he hoped to stop the offensive soon, but said it would depend on Hamas&apos; willingness to stop attacks and stop smuggling weapons into Gaza from Egypt. &quot;We have no interest in endlessly continuing the campaign. It will stop when the conditions that are essential for Israel&apos;s security are met,&quot; he said in the rocket-scarred southern Israeli town of Sderot. The army says it has dealt a harsh blow to Hamas, killing 130 militants in the past two days and greatly reducing the rocket fire. Hamas is believed to have 20,000 fighters. Israeli forces have seized the main Gaza highway in several places, cutting the strip into northern, southern and central sectors. Israel also has taken over high-rise buildings in Gaza City and destroyed dozens of smuggling tunnels \u2014 Hamas&apos; main lifeline \u2014 along the Egyptian border. A high-level European Union delegation met with President Shimon Peres on Tuesday in a futile bid to end the violence. Commissioner Benita Ferraro-Waldner acknowledged Israel&apos;s right to self-defense, but said its response was disproportionate. &quot;We have come to Israel in order to advance the initiative for a humanitarian cease-fire and I will tell you, Mr. President, that you have a serious problem with international advocacy, and that Israel&apos;s image is being destroyed,&quot; she said, according to a statement from Peres&apos; office. Israeli leaders say there is no humanitarian crisis and that they have allowed the delivery of vital supplies. French President Nicolas Sarkozy left Israel after a day of meetings with leaders. Sarkozy continued to Damascus, urging Syria on Tuesday to pressure Hamas to end the fighting. His Syrian counterpart, Bashar Assad, slammed the Israeli assault on the coastal strip as a &quot;war crime&quot; and &quot;barbaric,&quot; an &quot;aggression&quot; that Israel must halt. In Washington, the State Department said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was traveling to the United Nations Tuesday to try to broker a sustainable cease-fire. She planned meetings with Arab and European diplomats to lobby for a three-tiered U.S. truce proposal and will then attend a U.N. Security Council meeting on Gaza, spokesman Sean McCormack said. Key elements demanded by the U.S.: an end to rocket attacks on Israel from Gaza and securing border crossings between Gaza and Israel and between Gaza and Egypt.

Sarkozy did not mention Hamas.", "UNITED NATIONS (AP) \u2014 The Security Council failed to agree on action to end the escalating crisis in Gaza on Wednesday, but the U.S. threw its weight behind a cease-fire initiative and Egypt announced it will host separate talks with Israel and Hamas on the proposal. The U.N.&apos;s most powerful body was divided because Arabs are insisting on a legally binding resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of Israeli troops while the U.S., Britain and France want a weaker statement emphasizing that a &quot;durable cease-fire&quot; requires guarantees on reopening border crossings and preventing arms smuggling to Hamas. &quot;There is no unanimity today on either of those text,&quot; France&apos;s U.N. Ambassador Jean-Maurice Ripert, the current council president said after closed consultations, &quot;and because we want to go forward in a common approach we have decided to continue our talks and our negotiations.&quot; Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met into the night with counterparts from key Arab and European nations over the Security Council&apos;s next step. She emerged saying: &quot;We believe that there is still work to do.&quot; That view was echoed by the Saudi and Egyptian foreign ministers. The U.S., British and French ministers, as well as the Arab negotiators, extended their stay in New York and scheduled another closed-door session Thursday morning. Rice applauded the Egyptian-French cease-fire proposal and said she had talked with both the Israelis and Arab envoys about &quot;the importance of moving that initiative forward.&quot; Israel&apos;s government said earlier that it viewed the proposal positively but stopped short of acceptance. A Hamas official said the Islamic militant group, which rules Gaza, was not ready to either accept or reject the plan, which he claimed favored Israel. Egypt&apos;s top diplomats said Wednesday that Egypt plans to broker &quot;technical&quot; talks in Cairo separately with representatives of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas on the initiative. Egypt&apos;s Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit said he expected the Israeli team to arrive Thursday, but he stressed that there would be no meeting between Israel and Hamas, whose arrival date in Cairo is uncertain. Israel and the U.S. consider Hamas, which took control of Gaza in June 2007, a terrorist organization and Israel says it launched the current air and ground offensive because of persistent Hamas rocketing that has traumatized southern Israel. Aboul Gheit said Egypt will be asking Israel and Hamas for a temporary cease-fire &quot;that would lead to a consolidated permanent cease-fire.&quot; Then, he said, negotiations would take place with the European Union and the Palestinian Authority, which lost control of Gaza, on how to open the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian-Gaza border. Israel and the United States are demanding that border monitors destroy tunnels that Hamas has used to smuggle arms into Gaza from Egypt. Aboul Gheit said Egypt would next move to bring Hamas and all Palestinian organizations back to Cairo to try to get an agreement on a unity government, a coalition government, or a transition government \u2014 &quot;call it what you want.&quot; That is considered crucial to achieving the ultimate goal of an Israeli-Palestinian agreement that would see two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace. In Paris, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the Palestinian Authority supported the cease-fire initiative, but the administration of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has no sway in Gaza. Sarkozy did not mention Hamas. Israeli officials were noncommittal on the plan. &quot;Israel welcomes the initiative of the French president and the Egyptian president to bring about a sustainable quiet in the south,&quot; government spokesman Mark Regev said in Jerusalem. A Hamas representative in Lebanon, Osama Hamdan, said only that the group was considering the proposal, along with other ideas presented by Turkey and by Arab states. &quot;We are still studying the Egyptian proposal and I haven&apos;t said that we have rejected it. But we don&apos;t discuss the presence of monitors or international troops or forces to protect the occupation,&quot; he told Al-Arabiya television. In a potential warning sign, Hamdan complained that &quot;the initiatives mostly favor Israel.&quot; Arab ministers said one reason they are pushing for a Security Council resolution is Israel&apos;s refusal to give outright support the Egyptian-French initiative. &quot;They have been indicating willingness, or that it is a positive step, but there is not yet a clear-cut recognition and acceptance,&quot; Egypt&apos;s Aboul Gheit said. Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa said the 22-nation organization didn&apos;t want &quot;a statement to express views, but a decision on a resolution that calls for a cease-fire that has the weight of the Security Council.&quot; He said the Arabs do not want to put a resolution to a vote if it will be vetoed. &quot;We&apos;ll be pushing the Arab Group to push for a vote,&quot; Aboul Gheit said. &quot;If we would manage to get the draft passed, (so) be it. If not, we will be continuing our effort on the other level.&quot; The current Libyan draft resolution would almost certainly face a U.S. veto because it doesn&apos;t address Hamas arms smuggling, and doesn&apos;t even mention Hamas by name. Moussa said the draft was being revised, including to add an endorsement of the Egyptian-French initiative. U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad urged adoption of the presidential statement, saying there was &quot;broad support&quot; for it. The draft statement stresses &quot;the urgent need for an immediate and durable cease-fire,&quot; expresses &quot;grave concern at the deepening humanitarian crisis,&quot; and says the council &quot;will take comprehensive action as Egyptian and other international initiatives will materialize.&quot; A top French diplomat in Paris said the first aim of the initiative was to speed up Israeli-Egyptian negotiations on increasing security along Gaza&apos;s borders. Then talks would be held on reopening border crossings, he said. The latter negotiations could quickly lead to an Israeli military pullout from Gaza, said the official, who was close to the initiative and agreed to describe the sensitive contacts only if not quoted by name. Under the initiative, Turkey has been asked to put together an international force for Gaza, a Mideastern diplomat said.", "In Paris, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the Palestinian Authority supported the cease-fire initiative, but the administration of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has no sway in Gaza.

With the overall economy in the pits, movie moguls are just glad to have weathered the year with faithful audiences that continued to crowd into theaters. &quot;Last year was the record of all time. The economy&apos;s tough. Things are bad out there, and I think if we can have another record-breaking year or close to it, I figure we&apos;ll all be happy,&quot; said Dan Fellman, head of distribution for Warner Bros., which released the year&apos;s biggest hit with &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; ($531 million). Through New Year&apos;s Eve, 2008 domestic revenues are expected to come in just shy of 2007&apos;s record of $9.7 billion, according to box-office tracker Media By Numbers. Factoring in higher admission prices, the actual number of tickets sold in 2008 is running 5 percent behind last year&apos;s, when admissions totaled 1.4 billion. Hollywood historically survives recessions better than many businesses because movies remain relatively cheap compared with sporting events, live theater and other forms of entertainment. While consumer belt-tightening no doubt costs studios some cash, the list of 2008 blockbusters is a sign of a healthy business delivering the goods across every genre. With a $158.4 million debut, the Batman sequel &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; shattered the record for best opening weekend and has put Heath Ledger on track for a possible posthumous Academy Award as the maniacal villain the Joker. Paramount and Marvel Studios&apos; &quot;Iron Man&quot; was the superhero runner-up with a $318.3 million haul. Old-school hero Harrison Ford cracked his whip again as Paramount&apos;s &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; followed closely with $317 million. Among other smashes: Sony&apos;s Will Smith adventure &quot;Hancock&quot; and James Bond thriller &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;; Universal&apos;s action tale &quot;Wanted&quot;; and a rush of animated comedies led by the Disney-Pixar charmer &quot;WALL-E.&quot; While young males remained Hollywood&apos;s core audience, girls and women flocked to theaters for the Warner Bros. comedy &quot;Sex and the City&quot;; Summit Entertainment&apos;s vampire romance &quot;Twilight&quot;; Universal&apos;s musical &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;; and Disney&apos;s &quot;Hannah Montana&quot; concert flick. Quality-wise, the summer blockbusters came in a cut above the usual lineup of silly action and lowbrow comedy. Critics liked &quot;Iron Man&quot; and adored &quot;WALL-E&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight,&quot; the latter heading toward Jan. 22 Oscar nominations with best-picture buzz. The 2008 lineup showed that hit movies do not &quot;have to be a mindless concept,&quot; said Rob Moore, vice chairman of Paramount, whose 2008 successes also included the comedy &quot;Tropic Thunder,&quot; featuring fresh and wildly different performances from &quot;Iron Man&quot; star Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise. &quot;If you tell a compelling story, you can get an audience to show up.&quot; With a huge Christmas weekend, Hollywood continued to serve up must-see movies, from 20th Century Fox&apos;s family tale &quot;Marley &amp; Me&quot; to a surge of awards contenders such as &quot;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,&quot; &quot;Doubt,&quot; &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot; and &quot;Gran Torino.&quot; When they see films they like, audiences tend to come back for more. So the goodwill gained from recent successes should help carry the movie business into 2009 - as long as the movies remain good, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Media By Numbers. &quot;It&apos;s vitally important now more than ever that movies deliver, because people are careful about what they&apos;re spending their money on. So they have to be satisfied with the product,&quot; Dergarabedian said. &quot;When audiences use the movies as a retreat from their everyday troubles, that retreat had better make them feel good.&quot; --- Universal Pictures is owned by NBC Universal, a unit of General Electric Co.; Sony Pictures is a unit of Sony Corp.; Paramount is a division of Viacom Inc.; Disney&apos;s parent is The Walt Disney Co.; 20th Century Fox is owned by News Corp.

During a joint press conference, Spanish President Jos\ufffd Maria Aznar thanked Bush for his administration&apos;s &quot;kindness.&quot; &quot;Spain is a friend of the United States, and President Aznar is a friend of mine,&quot; said Bush.", "By Anne Applebaum (THE WASHINGTON POST, 05/06/07): It was a sunny day in June, and George W. Bush was making a speech at the University of Warsaw. Inside, the politicians listened with interest; outside, crowds gathered to cheer; afterward, the press was full of praise. Hard to imagine, but true: That\u2019s what President Bush\u2019s first visit to Poland was like \u2014 and I was there \u2014 in the unfathomably distant summer of 2001. On that same trip, Bush also went to Spain. During a joint news conference, the Spanish prime minister, Jos\ufffd Mar\ufffda Aznar, thanked Bush for his administration\u2019s \u201ckindness.\u201d Said Bush: \u201cSpain is a friend of the United States, and [Prime Minister] Aznar is a friend of mine.\u201d Not all of that trip went so smoothly: There were protests at a U.S.-European summit and elsewhere. Nevertheless, these predictable displays of outrage were tempered by the first hints of something new: a pro-American, European alliance consisting of Tony Blair\u2019s Britain, Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Italy, the center-right governments of Spain, Portugal and Denmark, and, of course, the ex-communist states of Central Europe. These were all countries that had recently undergone market liberalization, countries prone to resent the Franco-German domination of continental politics. In 2003, when Donald Rumsfeld slightingly referred to Germany and France as \u201cOld Europe,\u201d this vague, almost-alliance acquired a name, \u201cNew Europe.\u201d It meant pro-American, accepting of global capitalism and supportive of the war on terrorism. Not coincidentally, these were the countries that eventually made up the \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d in Iraq. A mere four years later, New Europe no longer exists. Aznar, Berlusconi and Blair are out of office or about to be, partly victims of failure in Iraq. Central Europe\u2019s mood has changed profoundly, from pro-American to deeply skeptical. This Friday, Bush plans to spend precisely three hours and 10 minutes on the ground in Poland, making no speeches, seeing no one much besides the Polish president. And it won\u2019t be a very wide-ranging discussion. Mortally wounded by Iraq, damaged further by the American administration\u2019s lack of interest in its concerns \u2014 change in the U.S. visa regime, military assistance \u2014 New Europe will probably now be killed off completely by American plans to build a missile defense shield in Poland and the Czech Republic. Belatedly, the State Department has done its best to promote the shield project, and pro-American politicians in both countries are scrambling to find a way to support it. But it remains deeply unpopular, and it isn\u2019t clear whether the parliament of either country could accept it. Europeans don\u2019t understand why a piece of equipment designed to protect the United States from Iran needs to be placed on their territory, particularly given that Iran in fact threatens Israel, not the United States or Europe. Nor do they see why they should accept without question the installation of military hardware that opens them up to new risks. This week the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, threatened to point his own nuclear missiles at Europe if the missile shield is built. \u201cIt is obvious,\u201d Putin told journalists on Sunday, that \u201cif part of the strategic nuclear potential of the U.S. is located in Europe and will be threatening us, we will have to respond.\u201d This is, of course, entirely cynical: There are good reasons to ask whether this particular system really has to be built right now, but it isn\u2019t \u201cstrategic nuclear potential,\u201d and it isn\u2019t designed to threaten Russia, as the Russians know perfectly well. Still, Putin\u2019s Cold War rhetoric is beginning to worry people all across the continent; he must be counting it a huge success. Yet it seems no one in the Pentagon ever imagined that there might be objections to the project, or that the locals might want some extra reassurance, or that a bit of judicious diplomacy might have smoothed the way in advance. According to some, the State Department didn\u2019t even know the missile shield was going ahead until the Pentagon had made the decision. Sound familiar? And all of this, every bit of it, was avoidable. Indeed, New Europe is expiring just as France and Germany have acquired leaders distinctly more pro-American than their predecessors. With a bit more attention and a bit less arrogance, the transatlantic alliance might now be reinvigorated instead of being angry and resentful.

Bush has said &quot;the time is now&quot; to grant independence to the Serbian province of Kosovo and called on Moscow not to slow down the process. &quot;I happen to believe it&apos;s important to push the process along,&quot; Bush said Sunday at a joint news conference with Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha. &quot;The question is whether or not there&apos;s going to be endless dialogue on a subject that we have made up our mind about. We believe Kosovo ought to be independent.&quot; Bush is the first sitting president to visit the Balkan state that was once a closed, communist society but is now a close ally of the United States. During his seven scheduled hours in Albania, Bush was spared the sort of protests that greeted his visits to Germany and Italy. Bush enjoys widespread popularity in the country: a street in front of Albania&apos;s parliament is named after him, several postal stamps bear his image and many Albanians donned red, white, and blue hats and waved American flags during Bush&apos;s visit. Albania&apos;s government supports independence for Kosovo, a province dominated by ethnic Albanians. His visit to Tirana follows last week&apos;s Group of Eight summit in Germany, where the leaders of eight major industrialized nations discussed Kosovo among many other topics. Bush said the G8 supported Kosovo&apos;s independence, but &quot;discussions were all aimed at determining if there is a way to make this acceptable to Russia.&quot; &quot;Obviously they&apos;re not there yet ... I&apos;m worried about expectations not being met in Kosovo and therefore we&apos;ll push the process.&quot; A vote on Kosovo&apos;s independence is before the United Nations Security Council, on which Russia holds a veto-wielding seat. Bush said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice would pursue the issue through diplomacy with Moscow along with America&apos;s European allies. But the diplomacy surrounding the issue seemed a bit fuzzy when Bush was asked about his call for a deadline on U.N. action on Kosovo. &quot;First of all, I don&apos;t think I called for a deadline, I thought I said (timetable),&quot; Bush said. Responding to the reporter, who could not be heard, Bush responded, &quot;I did, what exactly did I say? I said deadline? OK ... Then I meant what I said.&quot; Following his visit to Albania, Bush heads to Sofia, Bulgaria on Sunday and then returns home. &apos;Loving man&apos; Before the G8 summit, Bush visited Czech leaders in Prague then headed to Poland and Italy after the June 7-8 summit. He met Pope Benedict XVI at the Vatican on Saturday, his first meeting with the pontiff who succeeded Pope John Paul II following his death two years ago. (Full story) Following his visit to Albania, Bush headed to Sofia, Bulgaria on Sunday and will return to Washington on Monday. Russia and the United States have recently been at loggerheads over Bush&apos;s plan to set up a missile defense system in the Czech Republic and Poland. Bush, trying to ease Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s concerns, has repeatedly said the deployment of a missile defense system would not be aimed at Russia. Bush said he was open to discussing Putin&apos;s idea of jointly setting up a system in countries more friendly to Russia, such as the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. &quot;I thought his statement was a very important statement to make. In other words, he recognized that there&apos;s an opportunity to work together,&quot; Bush said. &quot;I viewed it as a very positive gesture and looking forward to continuing discussions on this very subject in July when he comes to Maine.&quot; CNN&apos;s White House Correspondent Suzanne Malveaux contributed to this report."], "triple": ["Bush", "heads to", "Sofia"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "Sofia", "subject": "United_States"}, "_id": 15480, "nouns": [["GPE", "Bush"]]}

The behind-the-scenes struggle between the two nations could explode into open warfare over a single misstep, analysts and U.S. military officials warn. Iraq has become a proxy battleground between Washington and Tehran, which is challenging \u2014 at least rhetorically \u2014 America\u2019s dominance of the Gulf. That has worried even Iraq\u2019s U.S.-backed Shiite prime minister, who \u2014 in a reflection of Iraq\u2019s complexity \u2014 also has close ties to Iran. Iran and the U.S. are already sparring on the ground. On Jan. 20, militants kidnapped and killed four American soldiers in a raid in Karbala, and a fifth American was killed in the firefight. The attack was so well planned and executed that Iraqi officials suspect Iran may have helped Shiite militiamen carry it out, perhaps in retaliation for the arrest of five Iranians by U.S. troops in northern Iraq. Those five Iranians, who were arrested in the northern city of Irbil, included two members of an Iranian Revolutionary Guard force that provides weapons, training and other support to Shiite militants in the Middle East, U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad said last week. Iraqi and Iranian officials maintain the five were diplomats. Since the Karbala raid, U.S. saber-rattling has intensified. President Bush said this week that U.S. forces in Iraq would take action against Iranian operatives in the country, while insisting he had no intention of attacking Iran. \u201cIf Iran escalates its military action in Iraq to the detriment of our troops and/or innocent Iraqi people, we will respond firmly,\u201d Bush told National Public Radio. Although little evidence has been made public, U.S. officials have long insisted that Iran was supplying weapons and training to Shiite militias in Iraq, including some that have killed American troops. The No. 2 U.S. general in Iraq told USA Today in an interview published Tuesday that Iran was supplying Iraqi Shiite militias with a variety of powerful weapons, including Katyusha rockets and armor-piercing rocket-propelled grenades. \u201cWe have weapons that we know through serial numbers ... trace back to Iran,\u201d Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno said. The Air Force is considering more forceful patrols on the Iraqi side of the border with Iran to counter the smuggling of weapons and bomb supplies, The Los Angeles Times reported, citing senior Pentagon officials. The U.S. is also building up its military presence in the Gulf in what it says is a show of strength directed at Iran. A second aircraft carrier is heading for the region, and Patriot missile batteries are being deployed. Since Bush announced his new Iraq strategy in early January, Iranian officials have raised the alarm repeatedly that the U.S. intends to attack. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Iran is \u201cready for anything\u201d in its confrontation with the U.S. A newspaper close to Iran\u2019s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei last week threatened retaliation for any U.S. military action \u2014 including stopping oil traffic through the Gulf\u2019s strategic Hormuz Strait and attacks on U.S. interests. The top editor of the Kayhan daily warned that Iran will turn the Middle East into \u201chell\u201d for the U.S. and Israel if America attacks. Iran and the U.S. also are in dispute over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. The U.S. accuses Iran of secretly developing atomic weapons \u2014 an allegation Tehran denies. Iran\u2019s defiant refusal to suspend uranium enrichment prompted the U.N. Security Council to impose limited economic sanctions. The U.S. has also beefed up support for Lebanon\u2019s government in its power struggle with Hezbollah, the Shiite militia that Washington accuses of acting in Iran\u2019s interests. The war of words has raised fears among both Democrats and Republicans in Congress that the U.S. and Iran are drifting toward armed conflict at a time when America is struggling against determined foes in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cWhat I think many of us are concerned about is that we stumble into active hostilities with Iran without having aggressively pursued diplomatic approaches,\u201d Sen. Barack Obama said Tuesday. It has also unnerved the Iraqi government, many of whose members have close ties to Iran. \u201cWe have told the Iranians and the Americans, \u2018We know that you have a problem with each other but we\u2019re asking you, please, solve your problems outside of Iraq,\u201d\u2019 Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki told CNN on Wednesday. \u201cWe do not want the American forces to take Iraq as a base to attack Iran ... we will not accept Iran using Iraq to attack American forces. But does this exist? It exists and I assure you it exists.\u201d As the rhetoric grows more strident, a U.S. military official in the Gulf likened the U.S.-Iran standoff to the buildup in hostility in Europe before World War I, when the assassination of the heir to the Austrian throne triggered a tragic war that engulfed a continent. \u201cA mistake could be made and you could end up in something that neither side ever really wanted, and suddenly it\u2019s August 1914 all over again,\u201d the U.S. officer said on condition of anonymity, because of the sensitivity of the issue. \u201cI really believe neither side wants a fight.\u201d Iranian coast guard vessels recently veered into territorial waters on the Arab side of the Gulf, an event that could have been viewed as either a mistake or a provocation, the officer said. Both sides are on tenterhooks. \u201cA boat crosses a line ... but what does it mean? You\u2019ve got to be very careful about overreacting,\u201d the officer said. Even if Iran pulled back from Iraq\u2019s conflict, it might not end the country\u2019s violence, said Kenneth M. Pollack, research director at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy. \u201cThe truth is that Iraq is a mess. It is in a state of low-level civil war. And all of these groups are largely self-motivated,\u201d he said on the Council on Foreign Relations Web site. \u201cBut it\u2019s much easier to blame it on the Iranians.\u201d In Tehran, political analyst Hermidas Bavand said U.S. force increases were leading many Iranians to believe Washington is looking to pick a fight. \u201cIt\u2019s an extremely dangerous situation,\u201d Bavand said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Tehran wants war under any circumstances. But there might be an accidental event that could escalate into a large confrontation.\u201d"], "triple": ["Bush", "told", "National Public Radio"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "National_Public_Radio", "subject": "George_W__Bush"}, "_id": 15489, "nouns": [["PERSON", "Bush"], ["ORGANIZATION", "National Public Radio"]]}

A drop in oil added to the pessimism Monday. Crude fell 8 percent to a new low for the year as investors bet economic weakness would curb demand.

With so many unknowns about when the economy might recover, analysts say most investors prefer to wait until they get a better read on companies&apos; quarterly numbers and, more important, their forecasts. Wall Street is expecting fourth-quarter and full-year earnings will be particularly bleak, especially after several companies warned last week that they are being hit hard by the recession. Aluminum producer Alcoa Inc., which last week announced it would slash production, fell again Monday after an analyst lowered his rating on the stock.

And the world doesn&apos;t hold its breath. Nothing is going to happen to nobody, people believe. Today, the Great Enabler is supposed to announce a historic change in Fed direction. Henceforth, instead of making money easier to get, it will be harder to get - by, most likely, one quarter of one percent. Alan &quot;Bubbles&quot; Greenspan has made money easier to get than any Fed chairman who ever lived. It was so easy to get for so long that a lot of people got a lot of it. Consumers had more (borrowed) money to spend than ever. That they spent it on cheap, imported goods was a wrinkle the Feds hadn&apos;t counted on. Instead of inspiring jobs and capital spending in the U.S., the EZ money merely encouraged Americans to ruin themselves - while the jobs and factories sprouted in Asia! Now, Greenspan&apos;s reputation\u2026and his economy\u2026count on the recklessness continuing. Which is too bad for everybody because inflation rates are edging up. Interest rates are beginning to anticipate even higher inflation. The bond vigilantes, aslumber longer than Rip Van Winkle, now stir. Last quarter, they woke up and began to sell\u2026it was the worse for bonds in 24 years. The Fed can&apos;t take this sitting down. It has to at least appear to protest. Its honor is at stake; which is to say, it doesn&apos;t have much to lose. So it intends to raise interest rates by .25% - enough to show its heart is in the right place, but not enough to trouble anyone&apos;s wallet. If the announcement comes as expected, we will take off our reading glasses and pause for a moment of silence, here at the Daily Reckoning office in London. The present trend has lasted longer than most marriages. A person could have bought a house in 1980 and refinanced almost every year - knocking almost a full percentage point off each time. Each year, he would have had more money to spend\u2026as his mortgage payments declined. Larry Kudlow, a neo-economist, has written a remarkable article explaining why &quot;this Bush Boom is a lot like the Reagan Boom 20 Years Ago.&quot; They are similar, we reply, but only in the same way that, say, Uma Thurman, stark naked, is a lot like Dick Cheney in a negligee. Both may have a certain appeal. It depends on your tastes. In every particular - especially the essential ones - the two are quite different. Bush is not Reagan. And America 2004 is not America 1980. Back then, stocks were cheap and gold was dear. Interest rates were high and bonds were low. It was, after all, before the boom began. If anyone knows how it can be compared to the period after the boom ends he doesn&apos;t work here in the building with golden balls (explanation below). 1980, we have explained, was contrary to 2004 in almost every way. America was still the world&apos;s biggest creditor - now, it is the world&apos;s biggest debtor. America still had a positive trade balance - now it has the biggest trade negative imbalance ever achieved by any nation. Americans were still, relatively, unburdened by debt. Now, they carry such heavy loads, they may collapse at any moment. Most important, the Reagan Boom and the Clinton boom that followed were largely, if not completely, driven by falling interest rates and EZ credit. Rising rates - which is what the Fed announces today - will have the exact opposite effect. A Bush boom? Don&apos;t count on it, dear reader. [Ed. Note: Safety is underrated. So it&apos;s also cheap.

By the mid-19th century the Ottomans were losing their grip and world interest once again focused on Israel.

In 1878 the first Jewish colony was founded, and before long the first Aliyah, or wave of immigrants, had started. At the same time, the Arab population of Palestine was becoming strongly nationalistic and anti-European, which did not bode well for the new arrivals. At the time of WWI, Britain promised Arabs they&apos;d recognise an Arab state, and Jews they&apos;d support a Jewish homeland in Palestine. When the war ended, Britain was given a mandate to rule the country, and as Europe moved towards WWII, Britain decided to stop all migration to Israel. Desperate illegal immigrants continued to arrive, and the Arab population responded violently. By 1947 the situation had reached an impasse, Britain gave up its mandate and a resolution was passed to divide the country between Arabs and Jews. On 14 May 1948 Israel came into being. Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon invaded soon after but were defeated and when a ceasefire was declared in May 1949, Israel had extended the territory under its control in Palestine.

Every table was taken at Lundum&apos;s - a fashionable eatery with a Danish motif. Diners put down trendy portions of gravlax, beef stroganoff and other Baltic specialties, apparently unaware that their world of money shuffling from nine to five during the week, and then weekends off to Spain or Scotland was beginning to wobble. House prices are going down in London. And according to recent figures from the British Retail Consortium, shoppers are either running out of money, or having a temporary bout of sanity. Britain has always been ahead of America. The Industrial Revolution began in England before making its way over to New England. England took the lead in empire, too - extending its control over much of the world, while America still minded its own business. Unionization began in Britain, and social welfare legislation, too. We Americans have always admired the English. We lived in plain wood houses out on the prairies or backwoods; imagine how our heads turned when we saw Westminster or Buckingham Palace! We butchered savage tribes out on the frontier; imagine how we envied Wellington! We ruled from sea to shining sea; Britannia ruled the ocean waves themselves, and almost everything they touched! American statesmanship - certainly under Wilson and Roosevelt - was often nothing more than a fawning imitation of the British. Where the English went, Americans followed. And when Roosevelt went to create his New Deal, all he had to do was to look over his shoulder at his English cousins. Neville Chamberlain began picking taxpayers pockets with his &quot;Widows, Orphans and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act&quot; in 1925. A property bubble began in Britain in the late &apos;90s. America&apos;s property price bubble did not begin until five years later, but house prices on the sceptered isle have been on a gentle decline for several months. And now the threat of recession is making its way to the lips of the Dr. Mervyn King and the pages of the Daily Mail. Can the Wall Street Journal be far behind? Average house sales prices in Manhattan fell in the last quarter by 13%, explains a news item. At the top end, the decline was 36%. On the other coast, sales in San Diego fell 4%. Could this be the beginning of something big? We don&apos;t know, but we will find out. More news from The Rude Awakening\u2026 -------------- Dan Denning, reporting from Colorado: &quot;Last week, I paid a visit to Royal Dutch Shell&apos;s oil shale project in Colorado.

We have no sure answer, but we have a guess. The world advances by fits and starts; in endless cycles of growth, correction, boom, bust, innovation and destruction. One success leads not to more successes, but ultimately to more failures, since life cannot follow life. Death follows life, and then life again. One business has to go broke so that a new industry can flourish. One tree has to fall so that the small seedlings beneath it will get the sun. Everything in nature - including markets - are self-limiting, and self-correcting. Mr. Greenspan seemed to have this natural cycle in mind when he cautioned central bankers at Jackson Hole last month. The silver lining he drew out by successfully stabilizing financial markets for so long seemed to have a cloud wrapped around it. Investors, and homeowners, took stability as a fact of life, and current market conditions as permanent. Why not borrow, they said to themselves? There will always be jobs, plentiful credit at lower rates, and higher asset prices. You&apos;d have to be a fool not to buy a house on these terms. On a website this morning, we saw an advertisement: &quot;$150,000 Mortgage - Just $483 per month!&quot; A man with $1,500 of free cash flow available could borrow $450,000 - about the average cost of a house in California in 2003. A year later, he had about $100,000 in &quot;equity&quot;. What was his investment? He had to live somewhere. He had merely &quot;rented&quot; a $450,000 house for $1,500 a month. His investment was zero. Thus has the entire nation been lured into debt like a teenager into a free strip show, knowing that it can&apos;t help but be interesting. But why cannot the next 10 years be just the same? Because once the man has committed his $1,500 - he can buy no more. Sales grow sluggish. Inventories build up. Eventually, prices fall\u2026as fellows decide to take their winnings off the table. [Ed. Note: When times are easy, investors love to take risks\u2026big risks. But too many risks at once really start to add up, as we&apos;re seeing now. When something triggers a sell-off, panic rises\u2026along with lots of market volatility. But in these moments of surging volatility, certain investors can make a fortune. Find out how: The One Thing Certain to Go Up\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *** Some $88 billion of corporate debt is &quot;on the brink,&quot; says a Bloomberg report. Hertz, Clear Channel and 616 other U.S. companies are in danger of having their corporate bonds downgraded to &quot;junk&quot; status. Of course, they will be in good company. Many of America&apos;s largest and most prestigious brand names are now junk - Sears, G.M., Kodak. G.M. bonds are rated BB, meaning they are two levels below investment grade. &quot;Business bankruptcies to rise 30% in third quarter,&quot; adds a headline from the L.A. TIMES. Not since the Great Depression has so much corporate debt been such poor quality. *** &quot;Thanks for your daily email, repetitive though it may be from time to time. There&apos;s nothing like reading ideas to which you already subscribe to increase ones conviction of being right,&quot; writes one DR reader. &quot;Anyway, I thought I&apos;d send you a note to tell you about a letter I found in a magazine published during the midst of the Civil War. I recalled this because it ties in with your comments today about the glorious practice of using others to fight your battles. &quot;The letter was written by a founding member of the religious organization I belong to when that man was traveling in Virginia seeking exemptions for his brethren from military conscriptions from the Confederate Army on the grounds of conscience. &quot;Interestingly, the author (Dr. John Thomas) writes a rather scathing observation of the agents of northern U.S. towns who had been sent south to buy the freedom of black slaves in order that they could then be conscripted into the Union armies to fight against the South in place of their new white &apos;owners&apos;. Ingenious. &quot;What is rather humorous about the letter is that Dr. Thomas tells about a poor agent from a northern, more western state that was sent with only $30,000 or so and was unfortunately outbid by an agent from Boston with over $400,000, who managed to buy up all the available slaves in the area. &quot;The only improvement the current government has made to this process is that it is able to do the same without using gold, but rather paper.&quot; --- Advertisement --- &quot;How I found the World&apos;s Best Investment, in\u00a0 the Underground Vault of a Private Swiss Bank&quot; Deep beneath Bahnhofstrasse street, in the heart of Zurich&apos;s financial district, I found a way to #1--Protect your family&apos;s wealth no matter what happens in the markets #2--Make potential gains of 500% or more, with limited downside risk.

Nicholls proposed to go there with Gray in 1771, but Gray was no longer equal to the exertion, and sent off Nicholls in June. Gray was then in London, but soon returned to Cambridge, feeling very ill. He had an attack of gout in the stomach, and his condition soon became alarming. He was affectionately attended by his friend and joint executor of Gray&apos;s will, the Rev James Brown (1709-84), master of Pembroke, and his friend Stonhewer came from London to take leave of him. Gray died in his rooms at Pembroke on 30 July 1771, and was laid in the same vault as his mother in the churchyard of St Giles at Stoke Poges on 6 August.

Of course, Gray who had a confessed passion for French, Italian and classical culture accepted. On 29 March, 1739, they set out on the prolonged continental tour. They spent the remainder of that year in France, and crossed the Alps in November. It is typical of the scholarly bent of his mind that he studied the De Bello Gallico as he travelled through France. Livy and Silius Italicus accompanied him as he crossed the Alps later. In Paris Gray cultivated a taste for the French classical dramatists, especially Racine, whom he afterwards tried to imitate in the fragmentary tragedy in blank verse Agrippina. They also visited Versailles and the small town of Reims, before they travelled south towards Lyon and Geneva. The whole of 1740 was passed in Italy. Gray had already learned Italian and made translations from Dante, Guarini, and Tasso. Gray made a long sojourn, principally at Florence, but Rome, Naples, and Herculaneum are also described in his letters. The spring months were spent with Horace Mann, the British minister at Florence, afterwards Walpole&apos;s well-known correspondent. In Florence Gray busied himself with a long work called De principiis cogitandi, which he never finished. Gray and Walpole returned to Florence from a visit to Rome in August, and remained there until April 1741 when they set out northwards for Venice. At Reggio, however, a quarrel took place, the precise circumstances of which are unknown. Obviously, both Walpole and Gray developed in rather different directions both in their personalities and respective interests. They parted in anger and were not reconciled until 1745. Gray spent a few weeks in Venice, and from there returned home alone, visiting for the second time the monastery of the Grand Chartreuse in its sublime scenery. He left in the album of the brotherhood his Alcaic Ode, O Tu, severi religio loci. Throughout his years abroad Gray had been a careful sightseer, made notes in picture-galleries, visited churches, and brushed up his classical associations. He observed, and afterwards advised (see his letter dated &quot;Stoke, Sept. 6, 1758&quot; [letter id 321]), the judicious custom of always recording his impressions on the spot.

Orlando Bloom stars as Balian, a blacksmith who has lost his family and nearly lost his faith. The religious wars raging in the far-off Holy Land seem remote to him, yet he is pulled into that immense drama. Amid the pageantry and intrigues of medieval Jerusalem he falls in love, grows into a leader, and ultimately uses all his courage and skill to defend the city against staggering odds. Destiny comes seeking Balian in the form of a great knight, Godfrey of Ibelin (Liam Neeson), a Crusader briefly home to France from fighting in the East. Revealing himself as Balian&apos;s father, Godfrey shows him the true meaning of knighthood and takes him on a journey across continents to the fabled Holy City. In Jerusalem at that moment -- between the Second and Third Crusades -- a fragile peace prevails, through the efforts of its enlightened Christian king, Baldwin IV, aided by his advisor Tiberias (Jeremy Irons), and the military restraint of the legendary Muslim leader Saladin (Ghassan Massoud). But Baldwin&apos;s days are numbered, and strains of fanaticism, greed, and jealousy among the Crusaders threaten to shatter the truce. King Baldwin&apos;s vision of peace -- a &quot;kingdom of heaven&quot; -- is shared by a handful of knights, including Godfrey of Ibelin, who swear to uphold it with their lives and honor. As Godfrey passes his sword to his son, he also passes on that sacred oath: to protect the helpless, safeguard the peace, and work toward harmony between religions and cultures, so that a kingdom of heaven can flourish on earth. Balian takes the sword and steps into history. Director: Ridley Scott.

According to the propagandists and their willing accomplices, everyone in America is actually more vulnerable to terrorism than we were before the September 11 attacks, the economy is in the crapper (or headed there), and the GOP is coming apart at the seams. They continue to tell us Bushs is the \u201cmost divisive and secretive\u201d administration in history. Bush would not even have been President but for the inappropriate, obviously political (and legally unsupportable) 5-4 decision of the United States Supreme Court. The MSM tells us Bushs administration has declared war on science, hates poor people, and is captive (at times) to Big Business, polluters, wealthy taxpayers, and the religious right. According to most American (and foreign) media, The Patriot Act is the most invasive corrosion on personal civil liberties in history, Republican leaders are hypocrites, and Bush alternates between being a hollow puppet, and at other times, a devoutly religious but stubborn simpleton incapable of complex thought and immovable on issues of import. According to these clowns, Bushs many shortcomings and multiple troubles are evident in his low approval ratings, the many public defections from leaders in his own party, and the poor reception of his latest Supreme Court nominee, Harriet Miers, and projections that the Democrats are poised to potentially make huge gains in coming elections. FOLKS, these fools are wrong. The Democrat party leadership is wrong. The Main Stream Media is wrong. In fact, here is something you may have forgotten. The Democrats and the Main Stream Media are (almost) always wrong! Want some examples? I could do one or two or three for each item listed above, but let me present some basic but illustrative proof. Barely three months ago, when the President tapped John Roberts to serve on the US Supreme Court, the uproar from the WRONG ones was loud and constant. Roberts was an extreme zealot, selected by Bush as a payback to the Religious Right, and destined to bitterly divide the US Senate. Editorials and columns published in the days after Roberts was first nominated said Roberts was picked not because of his qualification, but because of his lack of paper trail. His confirmation was likely to cause a party-line Senate vote, and would surely serve to further divide the already highly partisan American populace. What actually happened? The most secretive and most divisive administration in history promptly turned over more papers from Roberts work for the Federal Government than had ever been turned over for any judge in the history of the Republic. During his televised Senate Confirmation hearings, Roberts impressed nearly everyone as a brilliant scholar exceptionally well versed in the history of the US Supreme Court, the role of the Court, and every conceivable aspect of Constitutional law. Americans who watched the hearing favored (by a 4 to one margin) Roberts ascension to the Court. His confirmation in the US Senate garnered more votes than had been gathered by any nominee to the position of Chief Justice in American history! The hardcore Kool Aid peddlers on the left, even in the face of all these successes that proved them wrong, still insisted that Roberts had failed to live up to the Ginsburg Rule during his Senate hearings. That notion was finally and completely exposed as false when Justice Ginsburg herself said that Roberts had behaved exactly as he should have, according to her own rule. How many columnists, analysts and editorial boards admitted they were wrong about Roberts? If you said none, go to the head of the class. For months we have been hearing that the efforts by the Iraqi people to carve a new government out of the graveyard of tyranny have been failing; the attempt to aid the Iraqis in defending their own people have been floundering; Al-Queda and the insurgents are winning the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people; and, the infrastructure in Iraq is worse off now than it was under Saddam. For most of 2004, we heard that the Iraqi people wouldnt be able to hold an election in January 2005, and, if they did, there would not be widespread participation. When that widespread liberal prediction was proven wrong, they switched to entirely new lines of attack. For the last several months, we have heard that the Draft Constitution wouldnt get done, and the election regarding its approval would not proceed on time. What has actually happened in Iraq? The abilities of Iraqi military and police forces to defend Iraqis have progressed more rapidly than imagined. Despite specific efforts by the terrorist-led insurgents to try to discourage people from joining the defense and law enforcement branches, tens of thousands of Iraqis have signed up, been trained, and developed sufficient competence that overwhelming majorities of the country are defended by Iraqi forces. For every American who has died in Iraq, more than 10 insurgents, Saddam loyalists or foreign terrorists have been eliminated. More Iraqis have consistent reliable utility service today than at any point in Iraq history. This past weekends national election on the Draft Constitution had an extremely high participation rate (higher even than the turnout in the last US Presidential election). The conversion from tyranny to Democracy in Iraq is proceeding more quickly than any other in Human history. Al-Queda is on the ropes, financially, and their public support in Iraq is diving rapidly. How many columnists, analysts and editorial boards admitted they were wrong about Iraq? If you said zero, write yourself a pass to get out of class! I could go on, but I am almost out of time. I shall offer the following in summary form, and will, perhaps, add more details in subsequent entries. My main thrust is: the Democrat Party and the Main Stream Media are completely wrong. (and will continue to be) You believe them at your own peril. Senator Frist, Congressman Delay, Karl Rove and Scooter Libby will walk with very little penalty(because they broke no laws). Harriet Miers will be withdrawn by Bush, or, if kept in the mix, easily confirmed. Once withdrawn (very likely, because the whole thing is a play), she will be replaced by a rock-solid conservative jurist who will be confirmed by the full Senate. Bushs domestic agenda will thrive. The tax rate reductions will be made permanent, the marriage penalty will go away, the Death Tax will disappear. We will develop and implement a national energy policy involving reductions in our dependence upon foreign oil. Social Security will be modified. The Department of Defense will be reworked. Success in Iraq and Afghanistan will continue at a remarkable rate. Conditions in Syria, Pakistan, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, North Korea, China, Africa, Iran, Palestine and Israel will continue to improve, with the largest troublespot being free elections in Palestine this January. It will be wierd if Hammas gains many seats in the new government. We will win the War on Terror against stateless terrorism networks devoted to radical religious themes. The Republican Party will increase its margins in the US Senate and House, and in state legislatures, and in Governorships and Mayorships for the remainder of Bushs term. The emerging election trend (which will continue) will be the erosion of several of the various sub-constituencies in the Democrat party.

This basically means that the Tolkien Trust&apos;s attempt to block production of The Hobbit film will not be allowed to happen. So while New Line Cinema (and parent company Warner Brothers) may still be on the hook for the full amount of the Tolkien Trust&apos;s lawsuit ($150 million) in compensatory damages, the Tolkien Trust will not be allowed to block production of a Hobbit movie. 8/22/08 It has been announced that the screenplay for The Hobbit movie will be co-written by Producer Peter Jackson, Director Guillermo del Toro, and Lord of the Rings script co-writers Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens. This does not come as a surprise. Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens co-wrote the award-winning Lord of the Rings movie script, and del Toro has a history of writing his own scripts. 7/3/08 Guillermo del Toro spoke of The Hobbit movie recently at the Los Angeles film festival before the premier of his film Hellboy II and had some very interesting things to say. Del Toro signed on back in April to direct two films, The Hobbit and a &quot;bridge&quot; between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings with Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson as Executive Producer. In the recent interview with Sci Fi Wire del Toro hints that a second Hobbit movie may not be in the cards. Most original reports were that both Hobbit movies would be shot back to back, as the Lord of the Rings films were. Del Toro dismissed the idea, and expressed some doubt about a second movie. &quot;We believe there is a second movie,&quot; del Toro said. The copyright owned by the studio covers only The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, so any bridge story created would need to come from those source texts and their &quot;appendices&quot;. Writings published later in Unfinished Tales and The History of Middle-earth would be off the table and the material therein unusable. Del Toro adds: &quot;If there isn&apos;t, there will not be. If we find it, we will shoot it, but by God, if we do not find it, we will not shoot it. I am anxious to shoot the book, and I&apos;m willing and able to dedicate myself to shooting [the second film]. It is too early right now to say.&quot; In other news, names have been been bandied about concerning casting. Ian McKellen will be back as Gandalf, but the other roles remain wide open. One name that has been tossed out frequently for the main role of Bilbo Baggins is James McAvoy, but all involved deny that any negotiations have begun or decisions made.

His parents, Denis and Margery, soon moved with Ian and his sister Jean to the coal mining town of Wigan. It was in this small town that young Ian would ride out World War II. He soon developed a fascination with acting and the theater, which was encouraged by his parents. They would all bring him to plays, those by William Shakespeare in particular. The amateur school productions fostered Ian&apos;s growing passion for theatre. When Ian was of age to begin attending school, he made sure to get roles in all of the productions. At Bolton School in particular, he developed his skills early on. Indeed, his first role in a Shakespearian play was at Bolton, as Malvolio in Twelfth Night. Ian soon began attending Stratford-upon-Avon theater festivals, where he saw the greats perform: Olivier, Hiller, Gielgud,Richardson and Robeson. He continued his education in English Drama, but soon it fell by the wayside as he concentrated more and more on performing. He eventually obtained his Bachelor of Arts in 1961, and began his career in earnest. McKellen began working in theatre over the next few years. Very few people knew of Ian&apos;s homosexuality; he saw no reason to go public, nor had he told his family. They did not seem interested in the subject and so he saw no reason to bring it up. In 1988, Ian publicly came out of the closet on the BBC Radio 4 program, while discussing Margaret Thatcher&apos;s &quot;section 28&quot; legislation which would make the &quot;public promotion of homosexuality&quot; a crime. It was reason enough for McKellen to take a stand, and he has been active in the Gay Rights movement ever since. Ian currently resides in Limehouse, where he lives with his current lover of 8 years, Sean Mathias. The two worked together on the film Bent. To this day, McKellen works mostly in theater, and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 1990 for his efforts in the arts. However, he has managed to make several quite successful forays into film. He has appeared in several productions of Shakespeare&apos;s works including His well recieved &quot;Richard III&quot;, and in a variety of other movies. However it has only been recently that his star has finally begun to shine in the eyes of North American audiences. Roles in various films,&quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; and &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot;, riveted audiences. The latter in particular created a sensation in Hollywood, and McKellen&apos;s role garnered him several of awards and nominations,including a Golden Globe and an Oscar Nod.

Buddhism unlike Hinduism had a specific founder. Buddhism has as its beginning round 500 bc. The founder or Buddha was Siddhartha Guatama. Guatama was born into a wealthy family in India. His father was a King in northern east India. One day a priest prophicied over Siddhartha that he could be a great savior to the world if he left the palace. But if he remained in the palace he would only be a great king. This troubled his father who saw that his son would think of greater things by leaving the palace and ultimately giving away his kingly succession to the throne. Impressed by the priests prophecy Siddhartha left the palace to embark on a journey of &apos;enlightenment&apos; (McDowell,1992: 304-305). On his journey he saw &quot;four passing sites.&quot; He came across a feeble man, a sick man, a funeral procession and finally a man who begged for food on the street. He went back to the palace to leave for his journey of enlightenment. On his journey he was meditating under a fig tree. While meditating he reached what Buddhist call Nirvana. Nirvana is the highest state of consciousness. McDowell calls it &quot;God-consciousness.&quot; At this point he was no longer called Siddhartha but the Buddha, the enlightened One. After his vision he gathered five monks who had been with him on his journey and taught them what he had learned from his enlightened experience. He taught them that there were two extremes that should not be practiced in life. The first extreme is a life of wealth and self gain. He told them to forswear wealth, the riches of the material world, because these would only lead to pain. The other extreme that Buddha told his monks to avoid was one that was &quot;conjoined with self-torture, which is painful, ignoble, and useless.&quot; &gt;From these two extremes Buddha was teaching a life of simplicity. Buddha told the monks that there is a middle path. The middle path included eight ways or teachings; &quot;right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.&quot; Buddha also told them that pain or &quot;dukkha&quot; is a noble truth. The noble truth of pain is; &quot;birth is painful, old age is painful, sickness is painful, death is painful, sorrow, lamentation, dejection, and despair are all painful.&quot; Buddha also taught them that the noble truth of pain is &quot;the craving, which tends to rebirth, combined with pleasure and lust, finding pleasure here and there, namely the craving for passion, the craving for existence, the craving for non-existence.&quot; Buddha then told them that the goal in life was to live without pain. He said that &quot;the noble truth of the path that leads to the cessation of pain, the cessation without a remainder of craving, the abandonment, forsaking, release, non-attachment.&quot; By the end of his death at age 80, Buddha had spread his teaching throughout India (McDowell 306.) This truth is the key teaching of Buddhism. The idea is that man to gain true enlightenment must gain nothing that is not key to sustaining him. Simplicity for lack of a better western term would fit here (McDowell,1992: 305-307). In Theravada Buddhism says that the image or reality of the self is a source of &quot;bondage&quot; Gotama Buddha through an enlightenment experience made his self a &quot;gone-out no self&quot; He had reached nibbana. This meant that he had become or gained complete control of his lifein terms of responsiveness to others, the penetrating perception of their natures, his won expanded mental and spiritual powers, and total inward control, Gotama had become a type of &apos;superperson&apos; Also in Theravada Buddhism the belief in the self or idea of a fixed self can lead not only to bondage and suffering, but the idea of the self can lead to being reborn into the same bondage and pain. (Ingrham 166.) According to Access to Insight; Readings in Theravada Buddhism, Buddha when presented with the question about the existence or non-existence of the self, Buddha responded that it was a question best left alone. Left alone not for another revelation in time or rumination of enlightenment, but to hold to the question about a self or no-self, would ultimately lead to a stressful life of unease and unrest. In this sense, the anatta teaching is not a doctrine of no-self, but a not-self strategy for shedding suffering by letting go of its cause, leading to the highest, undying happiness (Bhikkhu.) Described in the Mahayana view of self-hood &quot;Fatsang&apos;s Hall of Mirrors.&quot; &quot;In the ceiling and floor, on all four walls, and even in the four corners of the room were fixed huge mirrors- all facing one another.&quot; This view of Buddhist self-hood places the Buddhist likeness or image in the middle. &quot;In each and every reflection of any [one] mirror you will find all the reflections of all the other mirrors, together with the specific Buddha image in each, without omission or misplacement&quot;(Ingram.158) In other words no self fixed can be found in the middle, only the reflection of the surrounding universe. &quot;All is Mind&quot; and this mind is but a nexus, a center point with out affixation. This I found to be one of the most explanatory examples of what Buddhists believe about the self. The idea is that which is giving the reflection and that which is receiving the reflection merges into one entity. This fusion is described in the phrase, &quot;all is Mind.&quot; The idea is that &quot;no self or entity has any self-inclosed, independent reality of its own&quot;(Ingram, 1986: 158). But what about the body? If we don&apos;t have a self then what about all of our emotions? What&apos;s to be said about the empirical reality? Buddha offers that we are five skandhas. Skandha roughly translated means &quot;heap, aggregate, or component of individuality.&quot; In other words we are as a being made up of five different components. The Five Skandhas are; &quot;First, form: Solidity, earth element, shape. Second, feelings: Sensations. Not just emotional feelings, but also physical sensations and so on. Whatever we feel. The third skandha is perceptions: Experiences, like thoughts, sights, sounds, and so on. In the second and third skandhas, in feelings and perceptions, liking and not liking arise. That&apos;s when the whole problem, the whole duality, the whole push and shove starts. The entire, exhausting treadmill or roller coaster of ups and downs. The fourth is will or volition: Intending to do things. That&apos;s where karma comes in. Liking and not liking arise, then from that devolves reactions. Reactions rather than freedom and proactivity. Our form feels things, perceives things this way or that way, liking or not liking. Then actions or intentions push or pull, trying to get more, get less, ignore it, or get away from it. Avoidance, denial, greed, demandingness, attachment, and so on, equals dissatisfaction and misery. And fifth is consciousness, or as Buddhism says, consciousness: States of mind&quot; (www.dzogchen.org.)"], "triple": ["Buddhism", "was born out of", "Hinduism"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "Hinduism", "subject": "Buddhism"}, "_id": 16215, "nouns": [["PERSON", "Buddhism"]]}

After 6 years of struggle, he then renounced asceticism, ate and drank, and then sat underneath the Bodhi tree, vowing to remain there until he understood how to escape from the cycle of rebirth. While sitting here, he had a revelation which he interpreted to mean that he understood the true nature of existence and thus was freed from the cycle of rebirth. Hence he was called the Buddha, &quot;The Enlightened One&quot;. He then spent the following 45 years preaching his ideas, setting up monasteries, and ordaining disciples. In the centuries after his death (called the parinirvana, as he entered that blissful and unexplainable state called Nirvana rather than being reborn), Buddhism spread throughout India, Southeast Asia and China. During this time it underwent many transformations, one of which was to divide into a number of different sects, based on different ideas of what the Buddha had actually meant in many of his pronouncements and on how to actually implement his ideas. Eventually these sects coalesced into three main divisions: Theravada, Mahayana and Tantrayana.

For a practising Buddhist it consists of maintaining the five Buddhist Precepts, which are to refrain from: 1.Deliberately causing the death of any living being; 2.Intentionally taking for one&apos;s own the property of another; 3.Sexual misconduct, in particular adultery; 4.Lying and breaking promises; 5.Drinking alcohol or taking stupefying drugs which lead to lack of mindfulness. Right Effort, Mindfulness and Concentration refer to the practice of Meditation, which purifies the mind through the experience of blissful states of inner stillness and empowers the mind to penetrate the meaning of life through profound moments of insight. Right Understanding and Thought are the manifestation of Buddha-Wisdom which ends all suffering, transforms the personality and produces unshakeable serenity and tireless compassion. According to the Buddha, without perfecting the practice of Virtue it is impossible to perfect Meditation, and without perfecting Meditation it is impossible to arrive at Enlightenment Wisdom. Thus the Buddhist Path is a Gradual Path, a Middle Way consisting of Virtue, Meditation and Wisdom as explained in the Noble Eightfold Path leading to happiness and liberation. 4. Kamma Kamma means &apos;action&apos;. The Law of Kamma means that there are inescapable results of our actions. There are deeds of body, speech or mind that lead to others&apos; harm, one&apos;s own harm, or to the harm of both. Such deeds are called bad (or &apos;unwholesome&apos;) kamma. They are usually motivated by greed, hatred or delusion. Because they bring painful results, they should not be done. There are also deeds of body, speech or mind that lead to others&apos; well being, one&apos;s own well being, or to the well being of both. Such deeds are called good (or &apos;wholesome&apos;) kamma. They are usually motivated by generosity, compassion or wisdom. Because they bring happy results, they should be done as often as possible. Thus much of what one experiences is the result of one&apos;s own previous kamma. When misfortune occurs, instead of blaming someone else, one can look for any fault in one&apos;s own past conduct. If a fault is found, the experience of its consequences will make one more careful in the future. When happiness occurs, instead of taking it for granted, one can look to see if it is the result of good kamma. If so, the experience of its pleasant results will encourage more good kamma in the future. The Buddha pointed out that no being whatsoever, divine or otherwise, has any power to stop the consequences of good and bad kamma. The fact that one reaps just what one sows gives to the Buddhist a greater incentive to avoid all forms of bad kamma while doing as much good kamma as possible. Though one cannot escape the results of bad kamma, one can lessen their effect. A spoon of salt mixed in a glass of pure water makes the whole very salty, whereas the same spoon of salt mixed in a freshwater lake hardly changes the taste of the water. Similarly, the result of a bad kamma in a person habitually doing only a small amount of good kamma is painful indeed, whereas the result of the same bad kamma in a person habitually doing a great deal of good kamma is only mildly felt. This natural Law of Kamma becomes the force behind, and reason for, the practice of morality and compassion in our society. 5. Rebirth The Buddha remembered clearly many of His past lives. Even today, many Buddhist monks, nuns and others also remember their past lives. Such a strong memory is a result of deep meditation. For those who remember their past life, Rebirth is an established fact which puts this life in a meaningful perspective. The Law of Kamma can only be understood in the framework of many lifetimes, because it sometimes takes this long for Kamma to bear its fruit. Thus Kamma and Rebirth offer a plausible explanation to the obvious inequalities of birth; why some are born into great wealth whereas others are born into pathetic poverty; why some children enter this world healthy and full-limbed whereas others enter deformed and diseased... The fruits of bad Kamma are not regarded as a punishment for evil deeds but as lessons from which to learn, for example, how much better to learn about the need for generosity than to be reborn among the poor! Rebirth takes place not only within this human realm. The Buddha pointed out that the realm of human beings is but one among many. There are many separate heavenly realms and grim lower realms, too, realms of the animals and realms of the ghosts. Not only can human beings go to any of these realms in the next life, but we can come from any of these realms into our present life. This explains a common objection against Rebirth that argues &quot;How can there be Rebirth when there are ten times as many people alive today than there were 50 years ago?&quot; The answer is that people alive today have come from many different realms. Understanding that we can come and go between these different realms, gives us more respect and compassion for the beings in these realms. It is unlikely, for example, that one would exploit animals when one has seen the link of Rebirth that connects them with us. 6. No Creator God The Buddha pointed out that no God or priest nor any other kind of being has the power to interfere in the working out of someone else&apos;s Kamma. Buddhism, therefore, teaches the individual to take full responsibility for themselves. For example, if you want to be wealthy then be trustworthy, diligent and frugal, or if you want to live in a heaven realm then always be kind to others. There is no God to ask favours from, or to put it another way there is no corruption possible in the workings of Kamma. Do Buddhists believe that a Supreme Being created the universe? Buddhists would first ask which universe do you mean? This present universe, from the moment of the &apos;big bang&apos; up to now, is but one among countless millions in Buddhist cosmology. The Buddha gave an estimate of the age of a single universe-cycle of around 37,000 million years, which is quite plausible when compared to modern astrophysics. After one universe- cycle ends another begins, again and again, according to impersonal law. A Creator God is redundant in this scheme. No being is a Supreme Saviour, according to the Buddha, because whether God, human, animal or whatever, all are subject to the Law of Kamma. Even the Buddha had no power to save. He could only point out the Truth so that the wise could see it for themselves. Everyone must take responsibility for their own future well-being, and it is dangerous to give that responsibility to another. 7. The Illusion of Soul The Buddha taught that there is no soul, no essential and permanent core to a living being. Instead, that which we call a &apos;living being&apos;, human or other, can be seen to be but a temporary coming together of many activities and parts - when complete it is called a &apos;living being&apos;, but after the parts separate and the activities cease it is not called a &apos;living being&apos; anymore. Like an advanced computer assembled of many parts and activities, only when it is complete and performs coherent tasks is it called a &apos;computer&apos;, but after the parts are disconnected and the activities cease it is no longer called a &apos;computer&apos;. No essential permanent core can be found which we can truly call &apos;the computer&apos;, just so, no essential permanent core can be found which we can call &apos;the soul&apos;. Yet Rebirth still occurs without a soul. Consider this simile: on a Buddhist shrine one candle, burnt low, is about to expire. A monk takes a new candle and lights it from the old. The old candle dies, the new candle burns bright. What went across from the old candle to the new? There was a causal link but no thing went across! In the same way, there was a causal link between your previous life and your present life, but no soul has gone across. Indeed, the illusion of a soul is said by the Buddha to be the root cause of all human suffering. The illusion of &apos;soul&apos; manifests as the &apos;Ego&apos;. The natural unstoppable function of the Ego is to control. Big Egos want to control the world, average Egos try to control their immediate surroundings of home, family and workplace, and almost all Egos strive to control what they take to be their own body and mind. Such control manifests as desire and aversion, it results in a lack of both inner peace and outer harmony. It is this Ego that seeks to acquire possessions, manipulate others and exploit the environment. Its aim is its own happiness but it invariably produces suffering. It craves for satisfaction but it experiences discontent. Such deep- rooted suffering cannot come to an end until one sees, through deep and powerful meditation, that the idea &apos;me and mine&apos; is no more than a mirage. These seven topics are a sample of what the Buddha taught. Now, to complete this brief sketch of Buddhism, let&apos;s look at how these Teachings are practised today. Types of Buddhism One could say that there is only one type of Buddhism and that is the huge collection of Teachings that were spoken by the Buddha. The original Teachings are found in the &apos;Pali Canon&apos;, the ancient scripture of Theravada Buddhism, which is widely accepted as the oldest reliable record of the Buddha&apos;s words. Theravada Buddhism is the dominant religion in Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos. Between 100 to 200 years after the passing away of the Buddha, the Sangha (the monastic community) split over the political question of &apos;Who runs the Sangha?&apos; A controversy over some monastic rules was decided by a committee of Arahats (fully Enlightened monks or nuns) against the views of the majority of monks. The disgruntled majority resented what they saw as the excessive influence of the small number of Arahats in monastery affairs. From then on, over a period of several decades, the disaffected majority partially succeeded in lowering the exalted status of the Arahat and raising in its place the ideal of the Bodhisattva (an unenlightened being training to be a Buddha). Previously unknown scriptures, supposedly spoken by the Buddha and hidden in the dragon world, then appeared giving a philosophical justification for the superiority of the Bodhisattva over the allegedly &apos;selfish&apos; Arahat. This group of monks and nuns were first known as the &apos;Maha Sangha&apos;, meaning &apos;the great (part) of the monastic community&apos;. Later, after impressive development, they called themselves the &apos;Mahayana&apos;, the &apos;Greater Vehicle&apos; while quite disparagingly calling the older Theravada &apos;Hinayana&apos;, the &apos;Inferior Vehicle&apos;. Mahayana still retains most of the original teachings of the Buddha (in the Chinese scriptures these are known as the &apos;Agama&apos; and in the Tibetan version as the &apos;Kangyur&apos;) but these core teachings were mostly overwhelmed by layers of expansive interpretations and wholly new ideas. The Mahayana of China, still vibrant in Taiwan, reflects an earlier phase of this development, the Mahayana of Vietnam, Korea and Japan (mostly Zen) is a later development, and the Mahayana of Tibet and Mongolia is a much later development still. Buddhism&apos;s relevance to the world today Today, Buddhism continues to gain ever wider acceptance in many lands far beyond its original home. Here in Australia, many Australians through their own careful choice are adopting Buddhism&apos;s peaceful, compassionate and responsible ways. The Buddhist Teaching of the Law of Kamma offers our society a just and incorruptible foundation and reason for the practice of a moral life. It is easy to see how a wider embracing of the Law of Kamma would lead any country towards a stronger, more caring and virtuous society. The Teaching of Rebirth places this present short lifetime of ours in a broader perspective, giving more meaning to the vital events of birth and death. The understanding of Rebirth removes so much of the tragedy and grief surrounding death and turns one&apos;s attention to the quality of a lifetime, rather than its mere length. From the very beginning, the practice of meditation has been at the very heart of the Buddhist Way. Today, meditation grows increasingly popular as the proven benefits to both mental and physical well being become more widely known. When stress is shown to be such a major cause of human suffering, the quieting practice of meditation becomes ever more valued. Today&apos;s world is too small and vulnerable to live angry and alone, thus the need for tolerance, love and compassion is so very important. These qualities of mind, essential for happiness are formally developed in Buddhist meditation and then diligently put into practice in everyday life. Forgiveness and gentle tolerance, harmlessness and peaceful compassion are well known trademarks of Buddhism, they are given freely and broadly to all kinds of beings, including animals of course, and also, most importantly, to oneself. There is no place for dwelling in guilt or self-hatred in Buddhism, not even a place for feeling guilty about feeling guilty! Teachings and practices such as these are what bring about qualities of gentle kindness and unshakeable serenity, identified with the Buddhist religion for 25 centuries and sorely needed in today&apos;s world. In all its long history, no war has ever been fought in the name of Buddhism. It is this peace and this tolerance, growing out of a profound yet reasonable philosophy, which makes Buddhism so vitally relevant to today&apos;s world. Are rebirth and karma for real? Is rebirth for real - either as a human or in one of the other realms? This is the question most Westerners ask as soon as they become interested in Buddhism. Karma (Pali: Kamma) - the law of cause and effect - operates across multiple lifetimes, but where&apos;s the proof that there is any life other than the current one? It&apos;s a complex subject and each tradition has its own explanation. It isn&apos;t uncommon for different teachers in the same tradition to have a different take on rebirth. One thing&apos;s for sure, there is no scientific proof of rebirth (yet). There are rational explanations, but they all rest on unprovable assumptions. One way to approach the question of rebirth is suggested by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, who says, &quot;You don&apos;t have to believe in rebirth, you just have to take it as a working hypothesis.&quot; Other teachers, such as Ajahn Summedho, have a similar view, that since we can never know what will happen after death, it makes sense to practise Dharma (Pali: Dhamma) and live this life in the best way possible. Some well-known monks, Ajahn Brahm and P.A. Payutto among them, say that when meditators reach the third or fourth jhana (level of absorbtion) they are able to &quot;read their past lives&quot; as the Buddha did and experience the truth of rebirth. But this ability is by no means universal, even among meditation masters. Another explanation championed by Buddhadasa, Thailand&apos;s most revered monk, is that rebirth in a series of physical bodies is &quot;conventional talk&quot; to make the subject understandable for the masses, but in &quot;Dharma talk&quot; what the Buddha really meant was that each life was the arising of the ego in the mind. So we experience &quot;death&quot; and &quot;rebirth&quot; (of the ego) many times each day. Similarly, the six realms of existence all correspond to states of mind. In the same way, the cause and effect of karma can be observed in our own mental states - when we do good deeds it results in a wholesome mental state, when we do bad deeds, we experience unwholesome mental states. This rational explanation of rebirth and karma doesn&apos;t necessarily exclude the traditional view. It augments it. What works for me is to take both of them as working hypotheses and practise accordingly. Recalling the Buddha&apos;s story about the man shot with a poisoned arrow, if we need to have every detail of the teaching proved to us at the outset, we&apos;ll be dead before we start practising. What is our purpose in life? The traditional answer to this is that our purpose is to attain nirvana and stop the endless cycle of rebirths and suffering. But the idea of a general purpose for mankind suggests that someone or something created that purpose, which in turn suggests an omnipotent deity. The way I think of it is that we have no pre-ordained purpose. We evolved, and here we are. Because we also evolved language and conceptual thinking, we got stuck with this concept of a self, an ego that makes us feel separate from everything else. The ego needs constant reassurance of its importance, which is why we cling to our views and defend them fanatically, and why we are constantly criticizing others. Our ego rules our lives. It is terrified of being snuffed out. We handle this in different ways. Some of us have lots of kids so we can feel that a part of us lives on forever through our descendants. Some of us perform heroic deeds so that our names will live on in history forever. Some of us get onto Ripley&apos;s Believe It Or Not with the world&apos;s longest moustache or beating the world record for smashing melons with our head, or some such nonsense, so that we&apos;ll achieve digital immortality. Some of us cling to the idea that a god will give us eternal life in some form after death. For those of us who don&apos;t find this pseudo-immortality or unguaranteed immortality satisfying, there&apos;s a need to create our own purpose in life. This is where Buddhism fits the bill nicely. Instead of being ruled by the ego and its fears, get rid of it! Being rid of the ego and the suffering it brings is what Ajahn Jagaro called &quot;True Freedom&quot; - a very appealing idea for all of us. If we don&apos;t achieve true freedom in this life, we should get another chance in a future life. But simply diminishing the ego and increasing freedom in this life seems like a worthwhile purpose to me. What&apos;s the difference between Theravada and Mahayana? To preserve the monastic order, the Buddha set down 227 rules for a bhikkhu (monk) to observe and 311 for a bhikkhuni (nun). Before his death (known as parinirvana) he said that some minor rules could be changed. Within a short time of his passing away there was disagreement over what could be changed and different sects emerged. The more reformist sects later called themselves Mahayana (greater vehicle) and referred to the conservative sects as Hinayana (lesser vehicle). The only conservative sect remaining today is Theravada, which is prevalent in Sri Lanka, Burma and Thailand. Theravada recognises the Pali Canon as its scriptures and a variety of ancient Theravadin commentaries. Whereas Theravada spread to the south and east, Mahayana moved to the northwest through what is now Pakistan and Afghanistan and then across Central Asia to China, Tibet, Vietnam, Korea and Japan. For historical reasons, the language of Mahayana scriptures was Sanskrit and that of Theravada was Pali. Hence the difference in spelling of some common Buddhist terms: Nirvana/Nibbana, Sutra/Sutta, Karma/Kamma, Dharma/Damma, etc. Westerners are more familiar with Mahayana Sanskrit terms. Mahayana also has its own scriptures in addition to the Pali Canon, the most important of which is the Lotus Sutra. These sutras are purported to be the Buddha&apos;s secret &quot;higher&quot; teachings, which were handed down only to those who were ready for them - an idea emphasised at the beginning of the Lotus Sutra. Apart from a modified monastic code which made monasticism possible in harsh environments such as Tibet, Mahayana emphasises the Bodhisattva Ideal, where a man vows not to achieve final enlightenment until all sentient beings have been saved. So anyone helping others to achieve enlightenment can be considered a bodhisattva. In Theravada, the term bodhisattva usually refers only to the historical Buddha in his previous lives. Historically, some Mahayanists consider Theravadins to be selfish for seeking enlightenment only for themselves, while some Theravadins consider Mahayanists to have deviated from what the Buddha taught. The various sutras and sects of Mahayana reflect different ways of reaching enlightenment appropriate for different people with different levels of ability. Because of this, a number of &quot;mythical&quot; buddhas and bodhisattvas are revered and used as objects of meditation. Theravadins revere only the historical Buddha and only his image is seen in temples. Mahayana tends to emphasise the concept of sunyata (void-ness) in its teachings and tends to have a more specific idea of what passes from rebirth to rebirth (consciousness, comprising awareness and memory). Personally, I found that the more I read about Mahayana and the Tibetan tradition known as Vajrayana, the more I accepted that all sects are going in the same direction and there is no point in considering any one of them better than another. Which tradition should I choose? I suggest reading about Theravada first and then investigating the other traditions to see which suits you best. Your decision may also depend on your Buddhist friends and what is available where you live. As far as I know, the main traditions known in the West are Theravada, Tibetan, Zen, Pure Land and Nichiren. One myth that seems to have grown up over the years is that with Mahayana one can reach enlightenment in one lifetime whereas with Theravada it takes aeons. This notion seems to have been pushed by the Chinese Zen patriarchs, in particular Huang Po, as illustrated in The Zen Teaching of Huang Po. In modern times the idea has been spread by influential author-scholar John Blofeld, who translated Huang Po&apos;s works into English and wrote several excellent books on Buddhism. But it all seems pretty ridiculous because how could anyone know how many lives ago any particular person started consciously working towards enlightenment? Blofeld followed Zen and then Tibetan Buddhist Tantrism, describing both as the &quot;Short Path.&quot; However, it isn&apos;t difficult to see that any tradition that emphasises meditation - as the Buddha did - will be a short path. In the past century, the Thai Forest Tradition is a good example of a Theravadin tradition that produced a number of enlightened masters. According to Blofeld, Mahayana and Tibetan Buddhism in particular offer ways of practice to suit people at every level. After all, not everyone has an aptitude for meditation. A lot of people prefer something simpler, such as praying, chanting, various forms of devotion and pilgrimages. He describes Zen and Theravada as &quot;formless,&quot; meaning the practice is mostly just you and your mind. But in fact there&apos;s a lot more to both than just meditation. Tibetan Buddhism seems to attract Westerners because there are now a lot of Tibetan lamas and monasteries in the West, because of the charisma of the Dalai Lama, because it can be a &quot;Short Path,&quot; because of its reputation for developing psychic powers and because of its many varied methods of practice. However, Tibetan Buddhism has absorbed much of the ancient, shamanistic Bon religion of Tibet, so it&apos;s wise to read up on Tibet thoroughly before committing to it. Zen attracts Westerners because it&apos;s something of a &quot;back to basics&quot; tradition with an emphasis on meditation and very little ritual. Sakyamuni, the historical Buddha, is revered rather than the other mythical buddhas and bodhisattvas of the Mahayana sutras. Although it originated in China, the type of Zen practised in the West is mostly Japanese. Theravada attracts Western practicioners because it is seen as the oldest and purest form of Buddhism, one that reveres only Sakyamuni and in theory concentrates on meditation. The Thai Forest Tradition which developed in the late 1800s was an effort to practise exactly as the Buddha did, wandering in the jungle and meditating in caves. Although the jungle is largely gone now, a number of Westerners joined Ajahn Chah&apos;s international monastery in the 1970s and later spread the practice in other countries: Ajahn Jagaro and Ajahn Brahm in Australia, Thanissaro Bhikkhu in the USA and Ajahn Sumedho in the UK. For a brief look at the origins of this tradition, see Thanissaro Bhikkhu&apos;s Customs of the Noble Ones. For a more detailed treatment, read Forest Recollections. Pure Land was once widespread in China and is still practised among Chinese around the world. A refined form of Pure Land (Jodo and Shin Jodo) developed in Japan and has spread to the West. Pure Land involves purifying the mind by chanting the name of the Amitabha (Amida) Buddha to gain help in reaching a realm after death from where it is easy to reach enlightenment. On a deeper level, Pure Land equals pure mind and Amitabha represents our own qualities rather than an external saviour. Pure Land is sometimes combined with Zen practice. Nichiren is a homegrown Japanese tradition advocating chanting of a phrase hailing the Lotus Sutra. An offshoot of Nichiren is the lay organisation, Sokka Gakai International. There are a few Buddhist sects and organisations that are controversial in some way, usually because of their founder/leader or his particular beliefs. Before getting involved with Sokka Gakai (SGI), the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order (FWBO), Shugden or Diamond Way (Karma Kagyu), you might want to google for information about their background. How do I become a Buddhist? Although there is a ceremony of taking the Three Refuges (the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha), there isn&apos;t any &quot;conversion&quot; involved and you aren&apos;t required to renounce any other religion or beliefs. In fact, it seems to be more of a social statement to show others that you have become a Buddhist. In my opinion, once you accept the Buddha&apos;s teachings as a way of life and try to follow the Five Precepts for lay people, you&apos;re a Buddhist. For me, this involved a lot of reading Dharma and listening to Dharma talks on the Internet. Rather than read the scriptures (which are often difficult), I chose books by monks and nuns who already had a deep knowledge of Dharma through study and practice, and who had a talent for explaining it. I looked at how Buddhism developed over the millennia and decided to start off with Theravada, which is the original form of Buddhism based on the Pali Canon. Later, I investigated the various Mahayana traditions too. It was obvious to me that reducing the power of the ego to control our lives was a foundation of Buddhism. For my practice, I concentrated on Right Speech (a component of the Noble Eightfold Path) because I thought it would give the fastest results. I expected if I started being nice to people, eventually they&apos;d be nicer to me. That happened, but much more than that. I found myself examining my intentions every time I felt like defending my views, arguing with someone, contradicting them, criticizing them, comparing myself with them or judging them in any way at all. Pretty soon it was obvious that much of what I said or did was designed to boost my sense of self-worth and that &quot;true freedom&quot; was to escape this tyranny of the ego. Later I started meditating, since this is the only way to experience the truth of the teaching rather than just understanding them intellectually. Even though the majority of people born into Buddhism may not meditate, it&apos;s essential for the serious Buddhist. Some Westerners have a problem with whether they are or aren&apos;t a Buddhist, usually because they still have some belief in god or because they haven&apos;t come to believe in rebirth. The following talk by Ajahn Jagaro, a Western monk of the Thai Forest Tradition, will be helpful for anyone asking himself, &quot;Am I a Buddhist?&quot; ________________________________________ Am I a Buddhist? by Ajahn Jagaro Teaching people who have only recently encountered Buddhism I am often asked the question &quot;How do you become a Buddhist?&quot; or &quot;How do you know when you are a Buddhist?&quot; This type of enquiry is indeed healthy and to be encouraged not only amongst those new to Buddhism but also for people born and raised as Buddhists. So go ahead and ask yourself: &quot;Am I a Buddhist?&quot; I expect that there will be many who will answer &quot;Yes&quot; and those who say &quot;No&quot;, but I wonder how many will be thinking &quot;Oh ... Ahm,.. I don&apos;t know.&quot; So let us contemplate this business of being a Buddhist a bit more. To begin our enquiry it may be worthwhile to know what the Buddha said on the matter. The following episode is taken from the Buddhist scriptures (Anguttara Nikaya, Vol IV): &quot;Once, the Lord dwelt amongst the Sakyans in the Banyan Tree Monastery at Kapilavatthu, and while there, Mahanama the Sakyan came to him and asked; &quot;How, Lord, does one become a lay disciple?&quot; &quot;When one has taken refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, then one is a lay disciple&quot;. &quot;How, Lord, is a lay disciple virtuous?&quot; &quot;When a lay disciple abstains from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying and drinking intoxicants, then he is virtuous.&quot; Here th "], "triple": ["Theravada Buddhism", "is the dominant religion in", "Sri Lanka"], "kbp_info": [], "entity_linking": {"object": "Sri_Lanka", "subject": "Theravada"}, "_id": 107242, "nouns": [["GPE", "Cambodia"], ["GPE", "Sri Lanka"], ["GPE", "Sri"], ["GPE", "Burma"], ["GPE", "Laos"], ["GPE", "Thailand"]]}

Well the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) must not have gotten the memo cause it seems they are doing their best to KILL IT! Last week January 16 in Atlanta a 30-man (est) SWAT team raided the offices of the Aphilliates Music Group. Several employees were detained, CDs, studio equipment, cars and bank accounts were confiscated, and DJ Drama &amp; DJ Don were arrested and later released on $100,000 bail. According to allhiphop.com they are being charged with the R.I.C.O. (Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organizations) laws, which were created to bring down the mafia and were used to attack the Black Panther party. Now one is probably thinking that this is another black eye for Hip-Hop. Another case of some one making it but just couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave behind the lure of the streets. What did the police find? Guns? Drugs? No, the purpose of the action was\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Mixtapes! I guess they were expecting more seeing how one of the agents said &quot;Usually, we find other crimes during these types of busts.&quot; But still, all of this over mixtapes? Well yes and no. The Players This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the first time the RIAA has taken action like this and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good indicator that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the last. RIAA stands for Recording Industry Association of America (www.riaa.com). It is the trade group that represents the U.S. recording industry. Their Mission \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is to foster a business and legal climate that supports and promotes our member creative financial vitality\u00e2\u20ac? i.e.: make sure they make the money and survive. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll come back to that word vitality in a moment. RIAA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1995-year end report had a warning of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the growing popularity of illicit DJ mixes in CD format\u00e2\u20ac? (source NYT 6/16/05). On May 12th 2005, a day before the death of Legendary Justo Faison, founder of the Mixtape awards, RIAA announced a crackdown on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pirated CDs\u00e2\u20ac?. On June 8th 2005 a RIAA representative accompanied the New York Police on a raid of an east village video &amp; record store, Mondo Kims. Five employees were arrested and 100s of CDs were confiscated. The police seemed to focus on Kim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well-stocked Hip Hop section. A RIAA official released a statement saying the police department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153steadfast commitment to the fight against piracy has stamped out yet another significant illegal operation\u00e2\u20ac?. Now the Police have arrested and charged DJ Drama and DJ Don with RICO charges. In each major raid the RIAA was trying to send a message. Mondo Kims was popular record shop that was frequented by industry types and the like. DJ Drama, who is on the cover of this months issue of XXL, is arguably the #1 Mixtape DJ in the country right now. He picked up 4 trophies at the recent Justo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mixtape Awards, Just signed a deal with TI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (one of only 3 hip hop artist to have a platinum record this past year) Grand Hustle/Atlantic records, and his mixtapes series \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Gansta Grillz\u00e2\u20ac? has a following that can challenge many Industry releases. In each case the association went after the big names to make a point that they were not playing around. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the bust and raids that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make the headlines that should be more alarming. According to one popular Boston Hip-Hop DJ, the same week that The Aphilliate Music Group was raided, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all mom &amp; pops stores that sold mixtapes were getting hit up 150gs each\u00e2\u20ac?. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s these attacks that tip the scales of making this an all out war on mixtapes and Hip-Hop in general. Decline of the OLD Media/Its Bigger than Hip Hop But why? Again we ask \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all over some mixtapes?\u00e2\u20ac? This is when we come back to that word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvitality\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. In the RIAA mission its says their job is to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153promote our members creative financial VITALITY\u00e2\u20ac?. Their client\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vitality is endangered. The recording industry, in fact the whole media structure, as we know it IS DYING! Look at the numbers: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 (USAToday 1/5/07) Overall album sales from 2001 were 712million. By 2004 they were 666.7million. And they are still dropping; compare 2005 sales\u00e2\u2020\u2019654.1 million to 2006 sales\u00e2\u2020\u2019 646.4 million. These drops don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be changing anytime soon. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 (NYT 1/19/07) Time Inc. recently announced that it was cutting almost 300 jobs from its magazines in order to focus more on their websites. 172 coming from the editorial staff. Time Inc. is a unit of Time Warner, one of the 6 media conglomerates (G.E., Disney, News Corporation, Viacom, and CBS). \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 (WIRED Magazine 12/06) October 2006, NBC Universal announced a cut of 700 jobs as part of a $750 million retrenchment plan. Due to advertisers waning interest. They are being attacked from all sides: recording, print, T.V., radio, and the web. Because while all these drops have been happening there have been rises: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 (USAtoday1/5/07) Digital track sales grew by 65% over 2005 and nearly caught album sales for the first time: 581.9 million tracks were sold, compared with 588.2 million albums. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 (WIRED Magazine12/06) Youtube\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online audience grew from 5million in Jan 06 to over 35million in Aug 06. By Sept. 06 they were getting 70 thousand uploads and a 100million hits daily These are the 2 examples of the new media. The old structure is scrambling to get in because they are not equipped for it. A large part of that is because of how the new media is fueled. Not by YOU, as Time Magazine would like you to believe, but by EVERYONE. The record labels are trying to grab control of the digital album thing but that came about from them trying to stop the P2P file sharing. Myspace and Youtube would be nothing without millions of people providing the content. What makes that content so potent is the networking it opens up. Mixtapes create a grassroots distribution network that provides big name and unknown artist access to place where they could not have gotten on their own. The old structure was not built for the PEOPLE to have so much power. They are losing control and they know it. Instead of figuring what they may have done wrong to end up in this place, they come after the consumer and increasingly the producers and emergent network of this new medium. They shut down mom &amp; pop stores for selling mixtapes. They sue 12-year-old suburban kids for downloading music. They arrest mixtape DJs, that get their music sanctioned by the record execs, and confiscate all of their equipment. The Mixtape Game So what does DJ Drama &amp; DJ Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest mean for the future of mixtapes? Well for one it has terrorized the mixtape community. As you read this 100s of online mixtape sites are disappearing. The mixtape industry is moving more and more underground. Soon it might be easier to find an I Love Castro poster in Miami than to find a mixtape. What would that mean for Hip Hop? In today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hip Hop, mixtapes are the corner stone. As a subaltern part of the record industry mixtapes have operated off the original essence of Hip Hop. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m neither being nostalgic nor purist. The first mixtapes started circulating around New York in the late 70s early 80s as DJ recordings of Hip-Hop Parties. You could hear the latest mc battles or the hot party you missed. It was one of the biggest reasons hip-hop was able to spread to all 5 boroughs of New York and across the country. Kid Capri is largely responsible for how we know mixtapes today. In mid 80s He began producing them in his house and made them clearer than the club versions. Down the line others innovated by taking acapellas and mixing them over different beats and creating the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exclusives\u00e2\u20ac? mixtapes (songs that have not yet been released by records labels). Along the way this progression has given rise to many things: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Alternative Economy: many local neighborhood store service mixtapes to communities, Many Previously unknown DJs and MCs blow up off of mixtapes. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Alternative distribution network: mom &amp; pop stores, street vendors, trunks of cars, and even some major retail outlets serve as part of a grassroots network \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Promotion service: Mixtape DJs break records better than mainstream corps. Primarily because of the relationship to the streets/people \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Alternative media: mixtapes are often experimental spaces for new styles, new beats. MCs and DJ often get away we saying and doing things on mixtapes that their major labels would let them. Many record labels (the same one that the RIAA say they are representing) caught on to the importance of this network. They give songs and money to DJs to make a mixtape around their artist. After 50cents meteoritic rise through the mixtape game, it would seem like some labels have a whole mixtape arm! Now here in lies what makes mixtapes, as opposed to downloading, difficult for the RIAA to tackle. They hold a peculiar position in that they help with sales and promotion of official albums while at the same time challenging copyright laws. Mixtapes like hip hop its self is a collaborative process. Remixing, sampling, tagging on a wall. All of these things challenge what we consider to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153legal\u00e2\u20ac\u0153. Mixtapes push the barriers of the old copyright laws. May be its time we made new ones, to fit our reality and our culture. In Light of this state/corporate terror what can we do? Artists should start to look into creative commons licenses: www.creativecommons.org We can even create our own much like the FAM Foundation: http://freethiscd.com/ There are already examples of folk doing this: www.freshoutmedia.com/about-us Fresh out Media allows artists to upload their songs onto their website for free promotion under the creative commons license. The Hip Hop Media Lab, which produces mixtapes with independent artists, is starting to use a version of the creative commons license as well: www.myspace.com/hiphopmedialab With Hip Hop being \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDead\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcKilled\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 maybe we can save it by doing what folks did in the beginning. Take what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been given and do our own thing. OPERATION RESTORE DRAMA is being set up to by Wend day to help support DJ Drama &amp; DJ Don.

The seven-days-a-week strip, which he has written and edited since its inception, is among the most successful of all syndicated adventure strips, appearing in 500 newspapers worldwide.

More recently, he collaborated with Stabur Video in a series of videotapes titled &quot;Stan Lee Presents the Comicbook Greats,&quot; in which he interviews top artists and writers.

Past the half-way stage in this 11-round event that has one rapid and one blindfold game in each round, the Indian ace now occupies sole second spot and also bridged the gap between him and the leader Levon Aronian of Armenia who played out draws with Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan in both the games. It is still a tight affair and there is no clear winner in sight. With five rounds still to go, Aronian is at the top of the combined points table on 7.5 while Anand is now close behind with seven points in his kitty. Five players are just half a point adrift of Anand at joint third. They are Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria, Peter Leko of Hungary, Vladimir Kramnik of Russia [Images], Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine and Magnus Carlsen of Norway. Anand misread an opening move in the blindfold game but thankfully there was no damage. The Indian ace mistakenly believed that Karjakin had moved his knight on the queen side when in fact it was on the king side and upon realising his mistake Anand was quick to recover. Despite the mistake, by the 23rd move the writing was on the wall when Anand played a crushing rook move to tighten the noose around his opponent. In the rapid game there was little for Karjakin as Anand yet again was on top from the beginning. However, it was not as bad as in the blindfold and somehow the Ukrainian youngster was able to maintain the balance. The game was eventually drawn. The blindfold game between Carlsen and Topalov may go down in Amber history as the &apos;Great Escape&apos;. The Bulgarian played another Caro-Kann and though he was doing fine, Carlsen missed a dangerous attack in the middle game.\ufffd Topalov reached a winning position only to see Carlsen begin his survival act. Topalov had eight minutes on his clock and the young Norwegian was down to seconds, but that didn&apos;t stop him from tricking his opponent. The game was eventually drawn. Topalov&apos;s misery continued in the rapid game as he failed to finish off from a winning position again. Carlsen defended with great tenacity and earned a draw when the position was repeated three times on 69th move.

July 1867 in Watkins Glen, New York - d. September 8, 1934 in Tudor City apartments, New York, New York) and Maud A. Humphrey (1867-1941). Belmont and Maud were married in June 1898. His father&apos;s ancestors were of Dutch, English, and Spanish origin. Bogart is a Dutch name meaning &quot;orchard&quot;. His mother&apos;s were largely of English descent and to a lesser extent Welsh. Bogart&apos;s father was a Presbyterian, while his mother was an Episcopalian. Bogart was raised in his mother&apos;s Episcopal church.", "Trivia Answer: Humphrey DeForest Bogart who was born on Christmas of 1899. His films include The Big Sleep (1946), Key Largo (1948) opposite his wife Lauren Bacall, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), The African Queen (1951) for which he won his only Academy Award (for Best Actor), and The Caine Mutiny (1954). Bogart was born in New York City. His birthdate has been a subject of controversy. It was long believed that his birthday on Christmas Day 1899 was a Warner Bros. fiction created to romanticize his background, and that he was really born on January 23, 1899, a date that appears in many references. However, this story is now considered baseless. Although no birth certificate has ever been found, his birth notice did appear in a Boston newspaper in early January 1900, which supports the December 1899 date. Bogart was a liberal Democrat. He organized a delegation to Washington, D.C., called the Committee for the First Amendment during the height of McCarthyism, against the House Un-American Activities Committee&apos;s harassment of Hollywood writers and actors. It&apos;s a little known fact that Bogart was an excellent chess player, almost of master strength. Before he made any money from acting, he would hustle players for dimes and quarters playing in New York parks and at Coney Island. The chess scenes in Casablanca had not been in the original script, but were put in at his insistence. By the mid-1950s, Bogart&apos;s health was failing. He was a heavy smoker and contracted cancer of the esophagus. He almost never spoke of his failing health and refused to see a doctor until January of 1956. A diagnosis was made several weeks later and by then removal of his esophagus, two lymph nodes, and a rib was too late to halt the disease, even with chemotherapy. Bogart had just turned 57 and weighed 80 pounds when he died on January 14th of 1957 after falling into a coma. His funeral was attended by some of Hollywood&apos;s biggest stars including: Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, David Niven, Ronald Reagan, James Mason, Danny Kaye, Joan Fontaine, Marlene Dietrich, Errol Flynn, Gregory Peck, and Gary Cooper, as well as Billy Wilder and Jack Warner."], "triple": ["Bogart", "was born in", "New York City"], "kbp_info": [["PERSON", "per:city_of_birth", "LOCATION"], ["PERSON", "per:cities_of_residence", "LOCATION"], ["PERSON", "per:city_of_birth", "LOCATION"]], "entity_linking": {"object": "New_York_City", "subject": "Humphrey_Bogart"}, "_id": 13276, "nouns": [["GPE", "New York City"], ["PERSON", "Bogart"]]}
